# Home Generator Guide

A generator keeps the lights, fridge, furnace blower and sump pump running when the grid goes down. The right one depends on what you need to power, how long outages last where you live, and which fuel you can store or pipe in.

**Size a generator for the running watts of everything you'll power at once, plus the extra starting watts of the largest motor. Portable and inverter generators cover essentials through a transfer switch; standby generators start automatically and can carry a whole house. Run portable generators outdoors only, at least 20 feet from the house, as the CPSC advises.**

## Types of generators

- **Portable:** wheeled units, usually gasoline or dual-fuel, that power essentials through extension cords or a transfer switch.
- **Inverter:** portable units with electronics that produce smooth power for electronics, quieter and more fuel-efficient at light loads.
- **Standby:** permanently installed outdoors, fueled by natural gas or propane, and started automatically by a transfer switch when the power fails.

## Sizing

Add the running watts of everything you'll power at once, then add the starting surge of the largest motor, such as a refrigerator or well pump. Our [generator sizing guide](/what-size-generator-do-i-need) walks through it, and the calculator above adds it up.

## Fuel

| Fuel | Energy content (EIA) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Gasoline | about 120,214 BTU per gallon | Widely available; goes stale in storage |
| Propane | about 91,452 BTU per gallon | Stores for years; more gallons for the same output |
| Natural gas | about 1,036 BTU per cubic foot | Piped in, no refueling, if the supply holds |
| Diesel | about 137,381 BTU per gallon | Common on larger units |

See [propane generator usage per hour](/propane-generator-usage-per-hour) for consumption and tank runtimes.

## What generated power costs

Small generators turn roughly a fifth of their fuel's energy into electricity, and the cost follows. At an assumed 20% efficiency, each kWh takes about 17,060 BTU of fuel. At an example $3.50 a gallon, gasoline power costs about 50 cents a kWh; at an example $3.00 a gallon, propane about 56 cents; and natural gas at $1.35 a therm about 23 cents, against an average grid rate of about 18 cents.

## Connecting to a house

Never backfeed a house through a wall outlet. It can energize the utility lines, endangering line workers and neighbors.

Use a transfer switch or a listed interlock installed by an electrician, under the National Electrical Code's rules for optional standby systems. See [how many amps a generator produces](/how-many-amps-does-generator-produce) for outlet and circuit ratings.

## Safety

The CPSC warns that portable generators can produce deadly levels of carbon monoxide. Run them outdoors only, at least 20 feet from the house, with the exhaust pointed away from doors, windows and vents, and keep CO alarms working inside. See [portable generator safety tips](/portable-generator-safety-tips).

## Maintenance

Change the oil and filters on the manufacturer's schedule, run a portable generator under load every month or two, and use stabilizer or drain the fuel for storage. Standby generators run brief automatic self-tests and need periodic service.

## Frequently asked questions

### What size generator do I need for my house?

Add the running watts of what you'll power at once, plus the largest motor's starting surge. Essentials often fit a portable unit; a whole house usually needs a standby generator.

### Which fuel is best for a generator?

Natural gas avoids refueling if your supply holds; propane stores for years; gasoline is the most available but goes stale.

### How much does it cost to run a generator?

At an assumed 20% efficiency, about 50 cents a kWh on gasoline at an example $3.50 a gallon, roughly three times average grid power.

### Is it safe to run a generator in a garage?

No. Even with the door open, carbon monoxide can build up to deadly levels. Run it outdoors, at least 20 feet from the house.
