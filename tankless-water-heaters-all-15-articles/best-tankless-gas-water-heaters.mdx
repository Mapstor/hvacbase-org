# Best Gas Tankless Water Heaters in 2026 (Natural Gas & Propane)

The best gas tankless water heater in 2026 is the **Navien NPE-2 240S** — a condensing unit delivering 199,900 BTU/h, a 0.96 UEF, and 5.4 GPM at a demanding 77°F temperature rise, with a built-in recirculation pump and 15-year heat exchanger warranty for $1,600–$1,900. For propane homes, the **Rinnai RU199iP** offers the same 199,000 BTU/h output in a proven LP configuration.

Gas tankless units outperform electric models on one critical metric: flow rate. Where the most powerful electric unit maxes out at 2.7 GPM at 77°F rise, gas condensing units deliver 4.5–5.5 GPM at the same rise — enough for two showers running simultaneously in any climate.

<TableOfContents />

## Why Gas Over Electric for Tankless

The physics are straightforward. Natural gas delivers roughly 100,000 BTU per therm. A 199,900 BTU/h gas burner can raise water temperature faster than even a 36 kW electric element. Here's the raw heating capacity comparison:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Gas vs Electric: Raw Heating Capacity"
  headers={["Metric", "Gas Condensing (199K BTU)", "Electric (36 kW)"]}
  rows={[
    ["Heat input rate", "199,900 BTU/h", "122,800 BTU/h (36 kW × 3,412)"],
    ["Usable heat (after efficiency)", "~191,900 BTU/h (at 0.96 UEF)", "~121,600 BTU/h (at 0.99 UEF)"],

Gas wins on raw throughput. Electric wins on conversion efficiency. For whole-home hot water in cold and moderate climates, gas is the only practical choice.

### Natural Gas vs Propane (LP)

Most gas tankless heaters come in both natural gas (NG) and liquid propane (LP) variants. The LP version has modified gas valves and orifices calibrated for propane's higher BTU content per cubic foot (2,520 BTU/ft³ vs 1,030 BTU/ft³ for natural gas).

Key differences:

- **Fuel cost:** Natural gas averages $1.10–$1.50 per therm nationally. Propane averages $2.50–$3.50 per gallon (91,500 BTU/gal, or about $2.73–$3.83 per therm equivalent). Propane costs roughly 2–3× more per BTU.
- **Gas line sizing:** LP models can use slightly smaller gas lines because propane is denser. But most manufacturers still specify 3/4" minimum.
- **Availability:** About 48 million U.S. homes use natural gas. About 7 million use propane, primarily in rural areas.
- **Performance:** Identical BTU output and flow rates between NG and LP versions of the same model.

<Callout type="tip">
**Propane users:** Your higher fuel cost means the payback on a condensing unit is even faster. The 0.93-to-0.96 UEF jump saves $100–$200/year on propane — that's a 2–4 year payback on the condensing premium.

## Detailed Reviews

### #1: Navien NPE-2 240S — Best Overall

**Why it's #1:** The highest combined score across our five criteria — efficiency, flow rate, warranty, value, and features.

The NPE-2 240S is Navien's second-generation flagship. The dual stainless-steel heat exchangers resist corrosion from both combustion gases and hot water, unlike single-exchanger designs that can develop pinhole leaks. The 0.96 UEF is verified by AHRI testing and qualifies for the 30% IRA tax credit.

The built-in ComfortFlow recirculation system includes a buffer tank and pump — no aftermarket recirculation kit needed. NaviLink Wi-Fi control lets you set recirculation schedules, monitor runtime, check for error codes, and receive descaling reminders from your phone. The 15-year heat exchanger warranty is 3 years longer than any Rinnai or Noritz model.

**Installation notes:** Two 2" PVC vent pipes (intake and exhaust). Max concentric vent run: 60 feet. Minimum 3/4" gas line. 120V/3A outlet for controls. Available in both indoor (NPE-2 240S) and outdoor models.

**Real-world example:** A family of 5 in Portland, OR (groundwater 48°F, 72°F rise needed) replaced a 50-gallon tank. The NPE-2 240S delivers 5.4 GPM — enough for two showers and a kitchen faucet simultaneously. Annual gas bill dropped from $410 to $275. Payback on the $3,800 install: 8.2 years, or 5.6 years after the IRA credit.

### #2: Noritz EZ111 — Best Efficiency

**Why it's #2:** The 0.97 UEF is the highest AHRI-certified efficiency in the residential gas tankless category.

Noritz's EZ series uses a unique fire-tube heat exchanger design that maximizes the surface area between combustion gases and water, extracting more heat per BTU than competing designs. The 11:1 turndown ratio (18,000–199,900 BTU/h) means the unit can modulate down to very low output for single-faucet use, virtually eliminating the cold-water sandwich effect.

The EZLink Wi-Fi module provides remote monitoring and diagnostics similar to Navien's NaviLink. The unit supports optional external recirculation (not built-in like Navien).

**Installation notes:** PVC/CPVC venting up to 65 feet. Compatible with concentric and separate vent configurations. Requires condensate neutralizer in most jurisdictions.

**Real-world example:** A couple in Denver, CO (5,280 ft elevation, 45°F groundwater) installed the EZ111 with the altitude derate kit. Effective output: ~175,000 BTU/h at altitude. Delivers 4.2 GPM at 75°F rise — enough for their 2-bathroom home. The 0.97 UEF saves $65/year vs a 0.93 UEF unit, paying for the Noritz premium in 5 years.

### #3: Rinnai RU199iN — Best Reliability

**Why it's #3:** The most field-proven platform with the largest service network in North America.

Rinnai has been selling tankless heaters in the U.S. since 1991. Their RU series benefits from decades of design iteration. The RU199iN isn't the most efficient (0.93 UEF) or the cheapest, but Rinnai's first-call resolution rate and parts availability are industry-leading.

The ThermaCirc360 recirculation system is available as an add-on. Scale detection alerts notify you before mineral buildup causes problems. Available in both indoor and outdoor variants (RU199eN for outdoor). Propane version: RU199iP.

**Installation notes:** Rinnai offers both concentric and twin-pipe venting options. Max vent run: 60 feet concentric. Their mobile app walks installers through commissioning, reducing installation errors.

**Real-world example:** A contractor in Atlanta, GA installed the RU199iN for a family of 6 with a 3,200 sq ft home. Groundwater at 62°F means only a 58°F rise — the unit delivers 7.2 GPM at that rise, handling three showers plus a dishwasher with room to spare. Five years in, zero service calls beyond annual descaling.

### #4–#6: The Mid-Range Condensing Tier

**Navien NPE-2 180S ($1,400–$1,700):** The same technology as the 240S at a lower output. At 180,000 BTU/h and 4.8 GPM at 77°F rise, it's correctly sized for 2–3 bathroom homes in moderate climates. Same 15-year warranty and built-in recirculation. The smart buy when you don't need 199,900 BTU.

**Rinnai RU160iN ($1,400–$1,650):** Rinnai's mid-output condensing unit at 160,000 BTU/h. Delivers 4.2 GPM at 77°F rise. Ideal for warm-climate whole-home use or as a primary unit paired with a point-of-use electric at a distant bathroom.

**Rheem RTGH-RH10 ($1,500–$1,800):** Rheem's condensing entry with built-in recirculation. The 0.93 UEF matches Rinnai, and the Home Depot/Lowe's distribution makes it the easiest condensing unit to source. The 12-year heat exchanger warranty is standard for the category.

### #7–#10: The Non-Condensing Value Tier

Non-condensing units make sense in two scenarios: replacing an existing non-condensing unit (stainless venting already installed) or when budget is the primary constraint.

**Rinnai V94iN ($1,000–$1,250):** The best non-condensing unit, period. At 199,000 BTU and 4.5 GPM at 77°F rise, it matches some condensing units on throughput. The 0.82 UEF is typical for non-condensing. Proven platform, 12-year warranty.

**Rheem RTG-84XLN ($900–$1,100):** Rheem's workhorse. 180,000 BTU, 4.0 GPM at 77°F rise. Hot-start programming reduces cold-water sandwich. Available everywhere, easy to service.

**Noritz NRC83 ($800–$1,000):** The lowest-cost name-brand unit that still delivers solid whole-home performance in warm climates. 157,000 BTU limits cold-climate use.

**Rinnai V75iN ($750–$950):** Entry-level Rinnai at 180,000 BTU. Shorter 10-year warranty. Best for budget installs in warm climates.

<Callout type="warning">
**Non-condensing trade-off:** The $400–$800 saved on the unit is partially offset by $200–$500 more expensive stainless steel venting AND the loss of the IRA tax credit (requires UEF ≥ 0.95). A condensing Navien NPE-2 180S at $1,500 with a $450 tax credit nets to $1,050 — barely more than a non-condensing V94iN at $1,125 with no credit.

## Gas Tankless Sizing Guide

### BTU Sizing Formula

**BTU/h = GPM × ΔT × 500 ÷ Efficiency**

Where GPM = peak simultaneous demand, ΔT = temperature rise (desired output minus incoming water temp), and 500 = constant (BTU to heat 1 gallon 1°F per hour).

<ComparisonTable
  title="Required BTU/h by Demand and Climate"
  headers={["Peak Demand", "Warm Climate (ΔT 50°F)", "Moderate (ΔT 65°F)", "Cold (ΔT 80°F)"]}
  rows={[
    ["3.0 GPM (1 shower + sink)", "~161K BTU", "~210K BTU", "~258K BTU*"],
    ["4.5 GPM (2 showers)", "~242K BTU*", "~314K BTU*", "~387K BTU*"],
    ["6.0 GPM (2 showers + dishwasher)", "~323K BTU*", "~419K BTU*", "~516K BTU*"],
    ["8.0 GPM (3 showers + fixtures)", "~430K BTU*", "~559K BTU*", "~688K BTU*"],
  ]}
/>

*Values exceeding 199,900 BTU/h require multiple units in parallel.*

### Parallel Installation

For homes needing more than 5.5 GPM at high temperature rises, two units in parallel are the standard solution. Each unit handles a portion of the demand, with a manifold distributing flow. Installation adds $1,000–$2,000 for the second unit's venting and gas piping, plus the cost of the unit itself.

**Parallel tip:** Use identical units from the same manufacturer. Navien and Rinnai both offer cascade control kits ($100–$200) that automatically balance the load between units and alternate which fires first, equalizing wear.

## Propane-Specific Considerations

### Propane Tank Sizing

A 199,900 BTU/h tankless unit draws approximately 2.18 gallons of propane per hour at full fire. Your propane tank needs to deliver adequate vapor pressure to sustain this draw:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Propane Tank Sizing for Tankless Water Heaters"
  headers={["Tank Size", "Max BTU/h Draw (20°F ambient)", "Supports 199K BTU Unit?", "Supports 160K BTU?"]}
  rows={[
    ["120 gallon", "~125,000 BTU/h", "No", "No*"],
    ["250 gallon", "~175,000 BTU/h", "No*", "Yes"],
    ["500 gallon", "~300,000 BTU/h", "Yes", "Yes"],
    ["1000 gallon", "~500,000+ BTU/h", "Yes (multiple units)", "Yes"],
  ]}
/>

*May work in warm weather but fails in cold weather when vapor pressure drops.*

**Critical:** A propane tank that's too small can't deliver enough vaporized gas, causing the water heater to shut down on error codes — especially in winter. Many tankless failures blamed on the unit are actually undersized propane tank problems. Work with your propane supplier to confirm tank capacity.

### LP Conversion

Some gas tankless models sell only as natural gas, with a separate LP conversion kit available. Others sell separate NG and LP SKUs with factory-calibrated orifices. Using the factory LP model is always preferred over a field conversion kit — the orifice sizing is more precise, and there's no risk of installer error.

## Real-World Gas Tankless Examples

### Example 1: Rural Propane Home — South Carolina

**Setup:** 2,000 sq ft farmhouse, 2 bathrooms, 500-gallon propane tank. Groundwater: 62°F. Peak demand: 4.0 GPM.

**Unit:** Rinnai RU160iP (propane, condensing, 160,000 BTU/h). Delivers 5.2 GPM at 58°F rise — 30% headroom above peak demand.

**Result:** Annual propane use for hot water dropped from 350 gallons (old tank) to 220 gallons. At $2.80/gallon, that's $364/year savings. Total install: $3,200. Payback: 8.8 years.

### Example 2: New Build — Suburban Dallas

**Setup:** 3,500 sq ft, 4 bathrooms, natural gas. Groundwater: 65°F. Peak demand: 6.5 GPM.

**Unit:** Navien NPE-2 240S. Delivers 6.8 GPM at 55°F rise — tight but adequate. Installed during construction (easier gas/vent routing).

**Result:** Annual gas cost: $215. Comparable tank would cost: $350/year. Install cost (new construction discount): $2,800. Payback: 5.9 years. IRA credit: $480.

### Example 3: Cold-Climate Upgrade — Buffalo, NY

**Setup:** 2,800 sq ft, 3 bathrooms, family of 5. Groundwater: 42°F. Peak demand: 7.0 GPM.

**Unit:** Two Rinnai RU199iN units in parallel with cascade control. Combined output: ~10 GPM at 78°F rise.

**Result:** Total install: $7,200. Annual gas savings vs 75-gallon tank: $280. Unlimited hot water for the first time — the family previously ran cold during morning shower routines. Payback is long (15+ years on energy alone), but the comfort upgrade was the primary motivator.

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What is the best gas tankless water heater for a large home?",
    answer: "For homes with 4+ bathrooms and peak demand above 6 GPM, the Navien NPE-2 240S is the best single-unit option at 5.4 GPM (77°F rise). For 7+ GPM demand (cold climates, 3+ simultaneous showers), install two units in parallel — either two Navien NPE-2 240S or two Rinnai RU199iN with a cascade control kit."
  },
  {
    question: "Is condensing worth the extra cost?",
    answer: "Almost always, yes. The $400–$800 condensing premium is offset by cheaper PVC venting (saves $200–$500 vs stainless), annual energy savings of $50–$200, and the 30% IRA tax credit (saves $400–$750 on the unit). In many cases, a condensing unit's net cost equals or beats a non-condensing unit after credits and venting savings."
  },
  {
    question: "What size gas line do I need for a tankless water heater?",
    answer: "Most gas tankless heaters require a minimum 3/4\" gas supply line for units up to 199,900 BTU/h. If the run from the meter is over 20 feet, you may need 1\" pipe to avoid pressure drop. Your installer should calculate the total gas load (tankless + furnace + range + dryer) and verify the meter can deliver adequate volume. An undersized gas line causes ignition failures and error codes."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I convert a natural gas tankless to propane?",
    answer: "It depends on the model. Some manufacturers (Rinnai, Rheem) offer LP conversion kits. Others (Navien, Noritz) sell dedicated LP models with factory-calibrated components. Using a factory LP model is always preferred — the orifice sizing is more precise. Field conversion kits work but carry a slightly higher risk of incomplete combustion or incorrect pressure settings."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run a gas tankless water heater?",
    answer: "Annual operating costs for a gas condensing tankless range from $150–$300 for natural gas and $350–$650 for propane, depending on usage and local fuel prices. A family of 4 using 60 gallons/day of hot water in a moderate climate pays roughly $200–$250/year on natural gas with a 0.93+ UEF unit. This compares to $300–$450/year for a standard gas tank heater."
  },
  {
    question: "Do gas tankless water heaters work during a power outage?",
    answer: "No. Even though the primary energy source is gas, all modern gas tankless units require 120V electricity to power the electronic ignition, flow sensor, control board, and gas valve. During a power outage, the unit cannot fire. A small UPS (uninterruptible power supply) rated at 300W+ can keep the unit running for 30–60 minutes. A whole-home generator is the permanent solution."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I descale a gas tankless water heater?",
    answer: "Descale every 12 months in areas with water hardness below 7 GPG (grains per gallon), and every 6 months above 7 GPG. In very hard water areas (15+ GPG), consider a whole-house water softener to protect your investment. Signs of scale buildup include reduced flow rate, fluctuating temperatures, and error codes (varies by manufacturer). DIY descaling costs $30–$60; professional service runs $100–$200."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between indoor and outdoor gas tankless models?",
    answer: "Indoor models require venting pipes routed through a wall or roof — PVC for condensing, stainless steel for non-condensing. Outdoor models are weather-sealed and exhaust directly to open air, eliminating venting entirely. Outdoor models include freeze prevention heaters and typically cost $100–$200 more, but save $300–$600 in venting materials and labor. Outdoor is simpler to install but requires protection from direct rain and adequate clearance from windows."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a gas tankless water heater at high altitude?",
    answer: "Yes, but you must account for derating. Gas appliances lose approximately 4% of capacity per 1,000 feet above 2,000 feet. At 5,000 feet (Denver), a 199,000 BTU unit effectively delivers ~175,000 BTU. Most manufacturers rate their units to 2,000–3,000 feet standard and offer altitude kits for 3,000–10,500 feet. Always size based on the derated output, not the sea-level rating."
  },
  {
    question: "Are gas tankless water heaters safe?",
    answer: "Yes, when properly installed and maintained. Gas tankless units have multiple safety features: electronic ignition (no standing pilot), flame sensors that shut off gas if the burner fails to ignite, exhaust temperature sensors, freeze protection, and overheat protection. The main risk is carbon monoxide from improper venting — which is why professional installation and annual inspections are essential. Outdoor models eliminate CO risk entirely."
