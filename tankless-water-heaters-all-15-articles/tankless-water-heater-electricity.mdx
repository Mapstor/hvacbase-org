# How Much Electricity Does a Tankless Water Heater Use? (kWh Breakdown)

An electric tankless water heater uses **8–20 kWh per day** for a typical household, costing **$1.00–$3.50 per day** at the national average electricity rate of $0.167/kWh. That translates to **$30–$105 per month** or **$365–$1,260 per year**, depending on your unit size, hot water usage, groundwater temperature, and local electricity rate.

The key insight: electric tankless heaters draw enormous power (18–36 kW) but only run for 20–60 minutes per day. They use zero electricity when no faucet is open — unlike tank heaters that cycle on and off 24/7 to maintain temperature.

<TableOfContents />

## The Core Formula

Electric tankless energy consumption follows a simple equation:

**kWh per day = kW rating x Hours of active heating per day x Load factor**

The load factor accounts for the unit's self-modulating technology, which reduces power draw based on demand. At a kitchen faucet (1.0 GPM), a 27 kW unit might only draw 12 kW. At two showers (4.0 GPM), it draws the full 27 kW. The average load factor for residential use is 0.55–0.75, meaning the unit runs at 55–75% of maximum power on average.

**Practical formula:**

**kWh/day = (Gallons of hot water per day x Temperature rise) / (5.86 x 60)**

This bypasses the load factor entirely by calculating from actual hot water usage.

### Example: Family of 4

Daily hot water use: 60 gallons. Groundwater temp: 55F. Desired temp: 120F. Temperature rise: 65F.

**kWh/day = (60 x 65) / (5.86 x 60) = 3,900 / 351.6 = 11.1 kWh**

At $0.167/kWh: **$1.85/day, $56/month, $678/year.**

## Electricity Usage by Unit Size

Here is the expected daily and monthly electricity consumption for every common electric tankless size, assuming a family of 3–4 using 50–65 gallons of hot water per day:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Electric Tankless kWh Usage by Unit Size and Climate"
  headers={["Unit Size", "Warm Climate (45F rise)", "Moderate Climate (60F rise)", "Cold Climate (80F rise)"]}
  rows={[
    ["8 kW (point-of-use)", "2–4 kWh/day ($10–$20/mo)", "3–5 kWh/day ($15–$25/mo)", "4–7 kWh/day ($20–$35/mo)"],
    ["13 kW (point-of-use)", "3–6 kWh/day ($15–$30/mo)", "4–8 kWh/day ($20–$40/mo)", "5–10 kWh/day ($25–$50/mo)"],
    ["18 kW (mid-range)", "5–9 kWh/day ($25–$45/mo)", "7–12 kWh/day ($35–$60/mo)", "9–16 kWh/day ($45–$80/mo)"],
    ["24 kW (whole-home)", "6–11 kWh/day ($30–$55/mo)", "8–14 kWh/day ($40–$70/mo)", "11–19 kWh/day ($55–$95/mo)"],
    ["27 kW (whole-home)", "7–12 kWh/day ($35–$60/mo)", "9–15 kWh/day ($45–$75/mo)", "12–20 kWh/day ($60–$100/mo)"],
    ["36 kW (whole-home)", "8–14 kWh/day ($40–$70/mo)", "10–18 kWh/day ($50–$90/mo)", "14–24 kWh/day ($70–$120/mo)"],
  ]}
/>

These ranges reflect household sizes from 1–2 people (lower end) to 4–5 people (upper end). Monthly costs assume $0.167/kWh (2026 national average).

<Callout type="info">
**Why the range is so wide:** A single person taking short showers uses 20–30 gallons per day. A family of 5 with a dishwasher and washing machine uses 80–100 gallons. Climate doubles the temperature rise. A single person in Florida (25 gal/day, 45F rise) uses 3.2 kWh/day. A family of 5 in Minnesota (90 gal/day, 80F rise) uses 20.5 kWh/day — a 6x difference.

## Electricity Cost by State

Your electricity rate dramatically affects the monthly cost. Here is what a typical family (60 gallons/day, 60F rise = ~10.2 kWh/day) pays across different states:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Monthly Electric Tankless Cost by State (60 gal/day, 60F rise)"
  headers={["State", "Avg Rate ($/kWh)", "Monthly kWh", "Monthly Cost", "Annual Cost"]}

    ["Hawaii", "$0.385", "306", "$118", "$1,416"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
**California and Hawaii reality:** At $0.27–$0.39/kWh, an electric tankless water heater can cost $80–$120/month to operate. In these markets, gas tankless (where available) is often cheaper to operate, and heat pump water heaters offer the best economics.

## Electric Tankless vs Tank: Energy Comparison

The common claim is that tankless heaters save 24–34% on water-heating energy. Here is the math:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Annual Energy: Electric Tankless vs Electric Tank"
  headers={["Metric", "Electric Tank (50 gal)", "Electric Tankless (27 kW)", "Savings"]}
  rows={[
    ["UEF (efficiency)", "0.92–0.95", "0.99", "4–7% more efficient"],
    ["Standby loss per day", "1.5–3.0 kWh", "0 kWh", "100% eliminated"],
    ["Active heating (60 gal, 60F rise)", "10.8 kWh/day", "10.2 kWh/day", "5.6% less"],
    ["Total daily usage", "12.3–13.8 kWh", "10.2 kWh", "20–26% less"],
    ["Annual usage", "4,490–5,037 kWh", "3,723 kWh", "767–1,314 kWh saved"],
    ["Annual cost at $0.167/kWh", "$750–$841", "$622", "$128–$219 saved"],
    ["Annual cost at $0.27/kWh", "$1,212–$1,360", "$1,005", "$207–$355 saved"],
  ]}
/>

The biggest source of savings is eliminating standby loss. A tank heater loses 1.5–3.0 kWh per day just keeping stored water hot, even when nobody uses any hot water. Over a year, that is 550–1,095 kWh of pure waste, costing $90–$300 depending on your electricity rate.

### Vacation Homes: The Killer App

If you own a vacation home that sits empty 75% of the year, standby losses are devastating. A 50-gallon electric tank wastes $270–$750 per year heating water nobody uses. A tankless unit uses zero electricity during those empty months. Annual savings: 70–80%.

## How to Reduce Electricity Usage

### 1. Lower the Set Temperature

Every degree below 120F saves roughly 3–5% on energy. Most fixtures work fine at 115F. Only dishwashers truly need 120F, and many modern dishwashers have internal heaters.

### 2. Install Low-Flow Fixtures

A 1.5 GPM showerhead uses 25% less hot water (and energy) than a 2.0 GPM head. A 1.0 GPM faucet aerator cuts sink usage by 33%. Total household savings: 15–25% less hot water demand.

### 3. Fix Leaks

A dripping hot water faucet at 1 drip per second wastes about 1,660 gallons per year — that is 2.7 kWh/day at a 60F rise, or $165/year at $0.167/kWh.

### 4. Time Your Usage

If your utility offers time-of-use (TOU) rates, shift heavy hot water use (dishwasher, laundry) to off-peak hours. Peak vs off-peak can differ by 50–100%, meaning a load of laundry costs half as much at 10 PM as at 5 PM.

### 5. Insulate Pipes

Insulating the first 6 feet of hot and cold water pipes from the heater reduces heat loss in transit. Foam pipe insulation costs $0.50–$1.00 per foot and installs in minutes.

## Gas Tankless Electricity Usage

Gas tankless units also use a small amount of electricity for their electronic ignition, control board, and flow sensor. Typical draw: 3–5 watts standby, 65–85 watts when firing. Annual electricity usage: roughly 50–100 kWh, costing $8–$17 per year.

This is separate from the gas cost. Including both gas and electricity, a gas tankless costs:

  rows={[
    ["Natural gas (60 gal/day, 65F rise)", "200–280 therms", "$220–$420"],

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How many kWh does a tankless water heater use per day?",
    answer: "A residential electric tankless water heater uses 8–20 kWh per day, depending on household size, hot water demand, groundwater temperature, and unit size. A single person in a warm climate uses 3–6 kWh/day. A family of 4–5 in a cold climate uses 15–24 kWh/day. The unit only draws power when a faucet is open — zero consumption at idle."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run an electric tankless water heater per month?",
    answer: "Monthly costs range from $25 to $120, depending on usage and electricity rate. At the national average of $0.167/kWh, a family of 3–4 pays $45–$75/month. In low-rate states like Louisiana ($0.104/kWh), costs drop to $25–$50. In high-rate states like California ($0.27/kWh), costs climb to $70–$120."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a tankless water heater use less electricity than a tank heater?",
    answer: "Yes — typically 20–26% less for the same hot water demand. The main savings come from eliminating standby loss (1.5–3.0 kWh/day that tank heaters waste keeping stored water hot) and the higher UEF efficiency (0.99 vs 0.92–0.95). A family of 4 saves 770–1,300 kWh/year, worth $130–$390 depending on electricity rate."
  },
  {
    question: "Will a tankless water heater raise my electric bill?",
    answer: "If you're replacing a gas tank with an electric tankless, your electric bill will increase (by $30–$80/month), but your gas bill will decrease (by $20–$40/month). The net effect depends on local gas vs electricity prices. If you're replacing an electric tank with an electric tankless, your electric bill will decrease by 20–26%. If you're adding a tankless where none existed, expect a $30–$105/month increase."
  },
  {
    question: "How many amps does a tankless water heater use?",
    answer: "Amperage depends on the kW rating. At 240V: an 8 kW unit draws 33A, a 13 kW unit draws 54A, an 18 kW unit draws 75A, a 24 kW unit draws 100A, a 27 kW unit draws 113A, and a 36 kW unit draws 150A. These are maximum draws — self-modulating units draw less at lower flow rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Can solar panels offset a tankless water heater's electricity use?",
    answer: "Absolutely. A 27 kW tankless using 10–15 kWh/day is well within the output of a typical 6–10 kW residential solar array (producing 24–40 kWh/day). If you time heavy hot water use during peak solar hours (10am–3pm), you can offset 50–80% of the water heating load. With a battery storage system, you can offset nearly 100%."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a tankless water heater use electricity when off?",
    answer: "Electric tankless units use zero electricity when no water is flowing. There is no pilot light, no standby heating, and no always-on circulation pump (unless you add one). The control board draws less than 1 watt in standby — essentially nothing. Gas tankless units draw 3–5 watts for the standby control board, costing about $5–$8/year."
  },
  {
    question: "How does water hardness affect electricity usage?",
    answer: "Scale buildup from hard water insulates the heating elements, reducing heat transfer efficiency. In hard water areas (above 10 GPG), un-descaled units can use 10–20% more electricity to achieve the same temperature rise. A unit that should use 10 kWh/day might draw 11–12 kWh/day with scaled elements. Annual descaling restores full efficiency."
  },
  {
    question: "What time of year does a tankless water heater use the most electricity?",
    answer: "Winter. Groundwater temperatures drop 10–20 degrees F in winter versus summer, increasing the temperature rise and energy required. In northern states, winter electricity usage can be 40–60% higher than summer. In southern states, the seasonal variation is smaller (15–25%). This is why annual cost estimates use an average of winter and summer values."
  },
  {
    question: "Is an electric tankless water heater energy efficient?",
    answer: "Extremely. Electric tankless units achieve a 0.96–0.99 Uniform Energy Factor (UEF), meaning 96–99% of electricity input becomes hot water. By comparison, electric tank heaters achieve 0.92–0.95 UEF, gas tankless hits 0.80–0.97 UEF, and gas tank heaters hit 0.58–0.70 UEF. Electric tankless is the most efficient technology per unit of energy input, though heat pump water heaters are more efficient overall due to their COP above 1.0."
