# Electric vs Gas Tankless Water Heater: Full 2026 Comparison

Gas tankless water heaters deliver 2–3x more hot water flow than electric models and dominate whole-home applications in cold climates. Electric tankless heaters cost 40–60% less to install, require zero venting, and reach near-perfect 0.99 UEF efficiency. The right choice depends on your climate, hot water demand, available infrastructure, and budget.

Here is every metric compared, with real numbers from 2026 product data.

## Efficiency: Electric Wins on Paper

Electric tankless heaters convert 96–99% of input energy into hot water. Gas condensing units convert 90–97%. Gas non-condensing converts 80–85%. On a pure efficiency basis, electric wins.

But efficiency is not the full picture. The relevant question is: **how much does each BTU of delivered hot water cost?**

### Cost Per Gallon of Hot Water

Using a 60F temperature rise (moderate climate):

<ComparisonTable
  title="Cost Per Gallon of Hot Water by Fuel Type"
  headers={["Fuel Scenario", "Energy Cost", "UEF", "Cost Per Gallon (60F rise)"]}
  rows={[
    ["Natural gas at $1.20/therm", "$1.20/therm", "0.93", "$0.013"],
    ["Natural gas at $1.50/therm", "$1.50/therm", "0.93", "$0.016"],
    ["Propane at $2.80/gal", "$3.06/therm equiv.", "0.93", "$0.033"],
    ["Electricity at $0.10/kWh", "$0.10/kWh", "0.99", "$0.017"],
    ["Electricity at $0.13/kWh", "$0.13/kWh", "0.99", "$0.022"],
    ["Electricity at $0.167/kWh (national avg)", "$0.167/kWh", "0.99", "$0.029"],
    ["Electricity at $0.20/kWh", "$0.20/kWh", "0.99", "$0.034"],
    ["Electricity at $0.27/kWh (CA avg)", "$0.27/kWh", "0.99", "$0.046"],
  ]}
/>

**Key finding:** Natural gas tankless costs $0.013–$0.016 per gallon of hot water. Electric tankless costs $0.017–$0.046 per gallon. Gas is cheaper to operate everywhere except areas with very cheap electricity (under $0.10/kWh) or very expensive gas (above $2.00/therm).

Propane tankless costs $0.033 per gallon — roughly equal to electric at $0.19/kWh. If your propane costs above $3.00/gallon, electric may be cheaper to operate.

<Callout type="info">
**The crossover point:** Electric tankless operating costs equal gas tankless when your electricity rate divided by your gas rate per therm equals approximately 0.078. At $1.20/therm gas, the electric breakeven is $0.094/kWh. Below that electricity rate, electric is cheaper. Above it, gas is cheaper.
</Callout>

## Flow Rate: Gas Wins Decisively

This is where gas pulls far ahead. The physics cannot be argued:

A 199,900 BTU/h gas burner delivers usable heat of roughly 186,000 BTU/h after efficiency losses (at 0.93 UEF). Converting to kW: that is approximately 54.5 kW of usable heating power.

A 36 kW electric unit delivers about 35.6 kW of usable heat (at 0.99 UEF).

Gas delivers **53% more heating power**. At a 77F temperature rise (typical northern U.S. winter), that translates to:

- **Gas condensing:** 4.5–5.4 GPM (two full showers plus fixtures)
- **Electric (36 kW):** 2.2–2.7 GPM (one shower, maybe a faucet)

For a family of 4 or more, or any home needing simultaneous multi-fixture hot water in a cold climate, gas is the only practical single-unit solution.

## Installation: Electric Wins on Simplicity

Electric tankless installation is fundamentally simpler:

**What gas requires that electric does not:** Gas supply line (3/4 inch minimum, possibly a new run from the meter), venting pipes through a wall or roof (PVC or stainless steel), condensate drain (for condensing units), combustion air supply, and carbon monoxide testing.

**What electric requires that gas does not:** Dedicated 240V circuits (2–4 of them), heavy-gauge copper wire from the panel, sufficient panel capacity (possibly a panel upgrade), and double-pole breakers.

**Installation time:** Gas takes 4–8 hours. Electric takes 2–4 hours (without panel upgrade).

**Who installs:** Gas requires a licensed plumber with gas certification. Electric requires a licensed electrician (for wiring) and can sometimes be done by a qualified plumber for the water connections.

### Installation Cost Comparison

<ComparisonTable
  title="Installation Cost: Gas vs Electric (2026)"
  headers={["Component", "Gas Condensing", "Electric Whole-Home"]}
  rows={[
    ["Unit", "$1,200–$2,500", "$350–$900"],
    ["Labor", "$800–$2,000", "$400–$1,000"],
    ["Infrastructure (gas line / wiring)", "$0–$1,200", "$150–$600"],
    ["Venting", "$100–$600", "$0"],
    ["Panel upgrade (if needed)", "$0–$200 (outlet)", "$0–$3,000"],
    ["Permits", "$50–$200", "$0–$200"],
    ["Total (standard install)", "$2,700–$5,000", "$1,100–$2,500"],
    ["Total (with infrastructure upgrade)", "$3,500–$6,500", "$2,500–$5,500"],
  ]}
/>

Without a panel upgrade, electric wins by $1,500–$2,500 on total installed cost. With a panel upgrade, the gap narrows to $500–$1,000.

## Climate: The Decision-Maker

Climate determines which fuel type is practical for whole-home applications. This is not a preference — it is physics.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Fuel Type Recommendation by Climate Zone"
  headers={["Climate Zone", "Groundwater Temp", "Temp Rise Needed", "Best Fuel Type", "Why"]}
  rows={[
    ["Southern (FL, TX, LA, AZ)", "60–75F", "45–60F", "Either works", "Low temp rise makes electric feasible for whole-home"],
    ["Mid-Atlantic (NC, VA, TN, GA)", "52–62F", "58–68F", "Gas preferred, electric possible", "Electric works for 1–2 fixtures; gas for 2+ simultaneous"],
    ["Midwest (IL, OH, MO, IN)", "45–55F", "65–75F", "Gas strongly preferred", "Electric only serves 1 fixture at this temp rise"],
    ["Northeast (NY, MA, PA, ME)", "40–50F", "70–80F", "Gas required for whole-home", "Electric cannot meet multi-fixture demand"],
    ["Northern (MN, WI, ND, MT)", "37–45F", "75–83F", "Gas required for whole-home", "Even gas needs 199K BTU for 2+ fixtures"],
    ["Pacific NW (WA, OR)", "42–52F", "68–78F", "Gas strongly preferred", "Similar to Midwest conditions"],
    ["Mountain (CO, UT, ID)", "40–55F", "65–80F", "Gas, with altitude derating", "Altitude reduces gas capacity 10–20%"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="important">
**The 55F groundwater line:** If your winter groundwater temperature is below 55F, a single electric tankless unit cannot reliably serve more than one fixture at a time. Above 55F, a 36 kW electric unit can handle 2 fixtures. This makes 55F groundwater the practical dividing line between electric-viable and gas-required for whole-home applications.
</Callout>

## Environmental Impact

### At Point of Use

Electric tankless produces zero emissions at the point of use. Gas tankless combustion produces CO2, water vapor, and trace NOx.

A gas condensing unit burning natural gas emits approximately 117 lbs of CO2 per million BTU. For a typical household (250 therms/year), that is about 2,925 lbs of CO2 annually from water heating alone.

### Including Grid Emissions

Electric heaters are only as clean as the grid that powers them. The national average grid emission rate is about 0.86 lbs CO2/kWh. For a household using 3,700 kWh/year on electric tankless, that is 3,182 lbs of CO2 — slightly more than gas.

However, grid emissions vary dramatically by state. In Washington (hydro-dominated), grid emissions are 0.08 lbs/kWh, making electric nearly carbon-free. In West Virginia (coal-dominated), grid emissions are 1.8 lbs/kWh, making gas the cleaner option.

**If you have solar panels,** electric tankless powered by your own solar is the cleanest option, period.

## Safety Comparison

<ComparisonTable
  title="Safety: Gas vs Electric Tankless"
  headers={["Safety Factor", "Gas", "Electric"]}
  rows={[
    ["Carbon monoxide risk", "Yes (improper venting)", "None"],
    ["Gas leak risk", "Yes (supply line failure)", "None"],
    ["Fire risk", "Low (sealed combustion)", "Very low (no combustion)"],
    ["Electrical shock risk", "Very low (120V only)", "Low (240V, but GFCI protected)"],
    ["Scalding risk", "Same (both have temp limits)", "Same (both have temp limits)"],
    ["Flood risk", "Same (no stored water)", "Same (no stored water)"],
    ["Freeze risk", "Moderate (outdoor models)", "Low (usually installed indoors)"],
  ]}
/>

Electric is objectively safer because it eliminates combustion-related risks entirely. Gas units are safe when properly installed and maintained, but the consequences of improper venting (carbon monoxide) are severe.

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Is a gas or electric tankless water heater better?",
    answer: "Neither is universally better — it depends on your situation. Gas is better for whole-home use in cold climates (groundwater below 55F), large families, and homes with existing gas service. Electric is better for warm climates, point-of-use applications, homes without gas, and solar-powered homes. Gas delivers 2–3x more flow; electric costs 40–60% less to install."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it cheaper to run a gas or electric tankless water heater?",
    answer: "Gas is cheaper to operate in most of the U.S. Natural gas tankless costs $200–$400/year; electric costs $365–$900/year at national average rates. The breakeven electricity rate is about $0.094/kWh — below that, electric is cheaper. Only a handful of states (Louisiana, Idaho, parts of the Pacific Northwest) have rates that low. Propane is comparable to electricity at $0.19/kWh."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch from gas to electric tankless?",
    answer: "Yes, but it may require significant electrical work. You will need 240V service with 75–150A of available capacity, which many homes lack. A panel upgrade ($1,500–$3,000) is often needed. You'll also lose substantial flow capacity — a gas unit delivering 5 GPM might be replaced by an electric unit delivering only 2.7 GPM at the same temperature rise. This switch works best in warm climates with lower flow demands."
  },
  {
    question: "Do gas tankless water heaters need electricity?",
    answer: "Yes — all gas tankless units require a standard 120V electrical outlet (3A) for the electronic ignition, control board, flow sensor, and exhaust fan. Without electricity, the unit cannot fire. A small UPS or generator can keep it running during power outages. The annual electricity cost for a gas tankless unit is about $8–$17."
  },
  {
    question: "Which lasts longer: gas or electric tankless?",
    answer: "Both types last 15–20+ years with proper maintenance. Electric units may have a slight longevity advantage because they have no combustion byproducts corroding internal components. However, gas units from top brands (Rinnai, Navien) routinely last 20 years in the field. The biggest lifespan factor is descaling frequency, not fuel type."
  },
  {
    question: "Can an electric tankless water heater run a whole house?",
    answer: "In warm climates (groundwater above 60F), yes — a 27–36 kW unit can handle a 2–3 bathroom home. In moderate climates (55–64F groundwater), it handles 1–2 fixtures at a time. In cold climates (below 55F), a single electric unit cannot serve a whole house — you need gas or multiple electric units. The limiting factor is the temperature rise vs available kW."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the most efficient tankless water heater?",
    answer: "Electric tankless heaters are the most efficient at 0.96–0.99 UEF — essentially converting 99% of electricity to hot water. Gas condensing units reach 0.90–0.97 UEF. However, efficiency does not determine operating cost — that depends on your local gas vs electricity prices. Gas is cheaper to operate in most markets despite lower efficiency."
  },
  {
    question: "Is gas or electric tankless better for the environment?",
    answer: "It depends on your grid's energy mix. Electric produces zero emissions at the point of use, but the power plant producing that electricity may burn fossil fuels. In states with clean grids (hydro, wind, solar), electric is significantly greener. In coal-heavy grid states, gas condensing may actually produce fewer total emissions. If you have home solar panels, electric tankless powered by solar is the cleanest option."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use both gas and electric tankless in one home?",
    answer: "Yes, and it is a smart strategy in some cases. Use a gas tankless as the primary whole-home heater (handling the heavy lifting), and add electric point-of-use units at distant fixtures (eliminating long pipe runs and wait times). For example, a gas Navien in the utility room plus an EcoSmart ECO 11 under the guest bathroom sink. This combination optimizes both capacity and convenience."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is easier to maintain: gas or electric tankless?",
    answer: "Electric is simpler. Electric units only need periodic descaling (vinegar flush every 6–12 months). Gas units need descaling plus annual burner inspection, venting check, air filter cleaning, and condensate drain maintenance (condensing models). Electric maintenance costs $30–$80/year; gas costs $80–$250/year."
