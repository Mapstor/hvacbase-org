# How Much Does a Tankless Water Heater Cost in 2026? (Unit + Installation)

A tankless water heater costs **$1,200–$5,500 installed** in 2026, with the national average at **$3,100** for a gas condensing whole-home unit and **$1,800** for an electric whole-home unit. The unit itself is only 30–50% of the total cost — installation labor, gas or electrical upgrades, venting, and permits make up the rest.

Here is every cost you will encounter, broken down by heater type, installation scenario, and region.

<TableOfContents />

## 2026 Average Costs at a Glance

<ComparisonTable
  title="2026 Tankless Water Heater Costs — Complete Breakdown"
  headers={["Type", "Unit Cost", "Install Cost", "Total Installed", "National Average"]}
  rows={[
    ["Gas Non-Condensing", "$700–$1,400", "$1,200–$3,000", "$1,900–$4,400", "$2,800"],

<Callout type="tip">
**Buying tip:** Plumbing supply houses often sell units $100–$200 cheaper than big-box retailers. Your plumber may get contractor pricing that beats both. Ask your installer for a bundled unit-plus-labor quote before buying the unit separately.

## Installation Cost Deep Dive

Installation is where costs vary the most. A straightforward replacement with existing infrastructure can cost $800. A ground-up retrofit with gas line upgrades and new venting can hit $4,000+.

### Gas Tankless Installation Costs

<ComparisonTable
  title="Gas Tankless Installation — Line-Item Costs"
  headers={["Component", "Low Estimate", "High Estimate", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Labor (plumber, 4–8 hours)", "$600", "$1,500", "Licensed plumber, local rates vary"],
    ["Gas line upgrade (1/2 to 3/4 inch)", "$0", "$800", "Only if existing line is undersized"],
    ["Gas line extension (new run)", "$0", "$1,200", "If unit is relocated"],
    ["Venting — PVC (condensing)", "$100", "$400", "Material plus penetration sealing"],
    ["Venting — Stainless (non-condensing)", "$200", "$600", "Category III stainless steel"],
    ["Condensate drain plus neutralizer", "$50", "$200", "Condensing units only"],
    ["Electrical outlet (120V/3A)", "$0", "$200", "If no outlet near unit"],
    ["Shut-off valves plus fittings", "$50", "$150", "Brass ball valves and unions"],
    ["Permit fees", "$50", "$200", "Plumbing plus gas permit"],
    ["Old unit disposal", "$0", "$100", "Recycling or dump fees"],
  ]}
/>

Total gas installation labor plus materials: $1,050–$5,350. The typical range for a standard condensing retrofit is $1,500–$2,500.

### Electric Tankless Installation Costs

<ComparisonTable
  title="Electric Tankless Installation — Line-Item Costs"
  headers={["Component", "Low Estimate", "High Estimate", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Electrician labor (2–6 hours)", "$300", "$800", "Licensed electrician required"],
    ["Breakers (2–4 double-pole)", "$40", "$120", "40A or 50A breakers"],
    ["Wire (8 or 6 AWG copper)", "$100", "$500", "2–4 circuit runs, distance-dependent"],
    ["Conduit and fittings", "$50", "$200", "EMT or flex conduit"],
    ["Panel upgrade (100A to 200A)", "$0", "$3,000", "Only if panel capacity insufficient"],
    ["Sub-panel (if needed)", "$0", "$600", "Alternative to full upgrade"],
    ["Water connections", "$50", "$200", "Shut-off valves and fittings"],
    ["Mounting hardware", "$20", "$50", "Wall bracket and screws"],
    ["Permit fees", "$0", "$200", "Electrical permit"],
  ]}
/>

Total electric installation labor plus materials: $560–$5,670. Without a panel upgrade, typical installs run $800–$1,500.

<Callout type="warning">
**Panel upgrade is the wild card.** If your home has a 100A or 125A panel, adding a whole-home electric tankless (27–36 kW) almost always requires upgrading to 200A. This single line item adds $1,500–$3,000 to the project. Have an electrician evaluate your panel capacity before committing to electric tankless.
</Callout>

## Regional Cost Variations

Labor rates vary dramatically by metro area. Here's how installation costs scale across the country:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Regional Cost Multipliers for Tankless Installation"
  headers={["Region", "Labor Multiplier", "Typical Gas Condensing Install", "Typical Electric Install"]}
  rows={[
    ["High-cost metros (NYC, SF, Boston, LA)", "1.4–1.6x", "$4,500–$6,500", "$2,200–$3,800"],
    ["Mid-cost metros (Chicago, Denver, Seattle, DC)", "1.1–1.3x", "$3,500–$5,000", "$1,800–$2,800"],
    ["National average", "1.0x", "$2,700–$4,200", "$1,400–$2,200"],
    ["Southeast (Atlanta, Charlotte, Tampa)", "0.8–0.95x", "$2,200–$3,500", "$1,100–$1,800"],
    ["Midwest/Plains (KC, OKC, Omaha)", "0.75–0.9x", "$2,000–$3,200", "$1,000–$1,600"],
    ["Rural areas", "0.7–1.2x", "$1,800–$4,000", "$900–$2,500"],
  ]}
/>

Rural areas have a wide range because while labor rates are lower, contractor availability is limited and travel charges add up. Some rural homeowners report 2–4 week waits for qualified tankless installers.

## New Construction vs Retrofit Costs

Installing tankless during new construction is significantly cheaper than retrofitting. The infrastructure (gas lines, venting, electrical circuits) is planned and run before walls are closed.

<ComparisonTable
  title="New Construction vs Retrofit Cost Comparison"
  headers={["Scenario", "Gas Condensing Total", "Electric Whole-Home Total"]}
  rows={[
    ["New construction", "$2,200–$3,500", "$1,100–$1,800"],
    ["Retrofit — same fuel type, same location", "$2,700–$4,200", "$1,400–$2,200"],
    ["Retrofit — tank to tankless, same location", "$3,000–$5,000", "$1,600–$3,000"],
    ["Retrofit — different location in home", "$3,500–$6,000", "$2,000–$4,000"],
    ["Retrofit — adding gas (no existing gas line)", "$4,500–$8,000", "N/A"],
  ]}
/>

The cheapest retrofit is a like-for-like replacement: gas tankless replacing gas tankless at the same location, reusing existing gas lines and venting. Add $500–$2,000 for any location change, fuel-type switch, or infrastructure upgrade.

## Tax Credits and Rebates (2026)

### Federal: Inflation Reduction Act Section 25C

The IRA offers a **30% tax credit, up to $2,000 per year**, on qualified high-efficiency water heaters. To qualify, tankless units must have a UEF of 0.95 or higher. This includes all electric tankless models and gas condensing models from Navien, Noritz, Rinnai (RU series), and Rheem (RTGH series).

Non-condensing gas units (UEF 0.80–0.85) do not qualify.

**Credit calculation example:** Navien NPE-2 240S costs $1,750. 30% credit = $525. The credit applies to the unit cost only, not installation labor. However, the IRS defines "qualified expenditures" to include some labor for installation of the qualifying property.

### Federal: HEEHRA Rebates

The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act provides point-of-sale rebates (not tax credits) for income-eligible households. Electric water heaters qualify for up to $1,750 in rebates. Eligibility depends on household income relative to area median income. Check your state's program status, as HEEHRA rollout varies by state.

### State and Utility Rebates

Many utilities and state energy offices offer additional rebates stacking on top of federal credits:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Example State and Utility Rebates (2026)"
  headers={["Program", "Rebate Amount", "Requirements"]}
  rows={[
    ["California SGIP + utility", "$200–$500", "ENERGY STAR certified, installed by licensed contractor"],
    ["New York NYSERDA", "$300–$700", "UEF 0.90+, must use participating contractor"],
    ["Massachusetts Mass Save", "$200–$600", "Gas tankless with UEF 0.90+"],
    ["Pacific Gas and Electric", "$150–$300", "High-efficiency gas or electric tankless"],
    ["Focus on Energy (WI)", "$200–$400", "ENERGY STAR certified"],
    ["Dominion Energy (VA)", "$100–$300", "High-efficiency gas water heaters"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="important">
**Stacking strategy:** You can combine the federal 30% tax credit with state rebates and utility rebates. On a $1,800 condensing gas unit, that could mean: $540 federal credit + $300 utility rebate + $200 state rebate = **$1,040 total savings**, dropping your effective unit cost to $760.
</Callout>

## Cost vs Savings: The Payback Math

The real question is not "how much does it cost?" but "how fast does it pay for itself?" Here are four scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Gas Condensing Replacing a Gas Tank (Moderate Climate)

- Installed cost: $3,500
- IRA tax credit: $525
- Net cost: $2,975
- Annual energy savings vs 50-gallon gas tank: $180
- **Payback period: 16.5 years**

### Scenario 2: Gas Condensing Replacing a Gas Tank (Cold Climate)

- Installed cost: $4,200
- IRA tax credit: $540
- Net cost: $3,660
- Annual energy savings: $240 (higher usage in cold climate)
- **Payback period: 15.3 years**

### Scenario 3: Electric Replacing an Electric Tank (Warm Climate)

- Installed cost: $1,800
- IRA tax credit: $165
- Net cost: $1,635
- Annual energy savings vs 50-gallon electric tank: $200
- **Payback period: 8.2 years**

### Scenario 4: Gas Condensing in New Construction (vs Tank Alternative)

- Incremental cost over a gas tank install: $1,200
- IRA tax credit: $525
- Net incremental cost: $675
- Annual energy savings: $180
- **Payback period: 3.8 years**

<Callout type="info">
**The new-construction advantage:** When building new, the incremental cost of tankless vs tank is only $800–$1,500 (because you need water heating either way). With tax credits, the payback drops to 3–5 years. In retrofits, the payback stretches to 10–17 years because you are paying full installation costs on top of a functioning system.
</Callout>

## Hidden Costs to Budget For

Beyond the unit and installation, these ongoing costs affect total ownership:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Ongoing and Hidden Costs"
  headers={["Cost Item", "Frequency", "Amount", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Annual descaling", "Every 6–12 months", "$30–$200", "DIY $30–$60, pro $100–$200"],
    ["Inlet filter cleaning", "Every 6 months", "$0", "DIY, 5 minutes"],
    ["Burner inspection (gas only)", "Annual", "$75–$150", "Part of annual service"],
    ["Heating element replacement (electric)", "Every 5–10 years", "$30–$50 each", "2–4 elements per unit"],
    ["Condensate neutralizer refill", "Every 1–2 years", "$15–$30", "Condensing gas only"],
    ["Recirculation pump maintenance", "Every 2–3 years", "$0–$100", "If equipped"],
    ["Extended warranty (optional)", "One-time", "$100–$400", "Extends coverage 3–5 years"],
  ]}
/>

**Annual maintenance budget:** $80–$250 for gas units, $30–$80 for electric.

## DIY vs Professional Installation

### What You Can DIY

Point-of-use electric units under 13 kW are the only tankless heaters suitable for DIY installation, and only if you are comfortable with 240V electrical work. The plumbing connections (two flexible hoses) are straightforward. The electrical work (running a dedicated 50–60A circuit from the panel) requires knowledge of wire sizing, breaker selection, and local code.

**Estimated DIY cost savings:** $200–$500 on a point-of-use unit.

### What Requires a Professional

Gas tankless, whole-home electric, and any unit requiring new gas lines, venting, or panel upgrades must be installed by licensed professionals. Most manufacturers void the warranty if the unit is not installed by a licensed contractor. A gas installation done incorrectly poses carbon monoxide poisoning risk, and an electrical installation done wrong creates fire hazard.

## Real-World Cost Examples

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to install a tankless water heater in 2026?",
    answer: "Total installed costs in 2026 range from $450–$1,050 for an electric point-of-use unit, $1,150–$3,100 for an electric whole-home unit, $1,900–$4,400 for a gas non-condensing unit, and $2,700–$6,000 for a gas condensing unit. The national average for a gas condensing install is $3,100. Regional labor rates, gas line or panel upgrades, and venting complexity are the biggest cost variables."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it cheaper to install gas or electric tankless?",
    answer: "Electric tankless is cheaper to install in most cases. A whole-home electric unit (27–36 kW) costs $1,150–$3,100 installed, versus $2,700–$6,000 for gas condensing. However, if your electrical panel needs an upgrade ($1,500–$3,000), the gap narrows significantly. If your home already has a properly sized gas line and you are replacing an existing gas unit, gas-to-gas swaps can be competitive at $1,900–$3,500."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a tankless water heater increase home value?",
    answer: "A tankless water heater can add $1,000–$3,000 in perceived home value according to real estate appraisers, though the exact figure varies by market. Buyers value the energy efficiency, unlimited hot water, space savings, and long lifespan. In energy-conscious markets (California, Pacific Northwest, Colorado), the premium is higher. It's rarely a 1:1 return on investment, but it does improve marketability."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a plumber charge to install a tankless water heater?",
    answer: "Plumber labor for tankless installation runs $600–$1,800 depending on complexity and region. A simple like-for-like gas tankless swap takes 4–5 hours at $100–$200 per hour. A full retrofit with gas line upgrades, venting, and condensate drain takes 6–10 hours. Some plumbers offer flat-rate pricing for standard installs: $1,200–$2,000 for gas, $500–$1,000 for electric (water connections only; electrician handles wiring)."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the hidden costs of tankless water heaters?",
    answer: "Beyond the unit and install, plan for: annual descaling ($30–$200 per year), gas line upgrades ($300–$1,200 if your existing line is 1/2 inch), electrical panel upgrades ($1,500–$3,000 if your panel lacks capacity), venting modifications ($100–$600), permits ($50–$200), and the rare heating element replacement ($30–$50 per element every 5–10 years on electric units)."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to convert from tank to tankless?",
    answer: "Converting from a tank to a tankless water heater typically costs $500–$2,000 more than a standard tankless install, due to infrastructure changes: gas line upgrades, new venting routes, removal and disposal of the old tank, and potentially capping old gas or water lines. Budget $2,500–$5,500 total for a gas conversion, or $1,500–$3,500 for electric."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit to install a tankless water heater?",
    answer: "Yes, in nearly all U.S. jurisdictions. Gas installs require a plumbing permit and often a separate gas-line permit. Electric installs may require an electrical permit for new circuits. Permits cost $50–$200 and ensure the work meets local building codes. Working without a permit can void your warranty, create liability issues, and complicate future home sales."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does annual tankless maintenance cost?",
    answer: "Annual maintenance costs $80–$250 for gas units and $30–$80 for electric units. The primary cost is descaling: $30–$60 for a DIY vinegar flush, or $100–$200 for professional service. Gas units also need a burner inspection ($75–$150), which most HVAC technicians can do during an annual service visit. In hard water areas (above 10 GPG), descale every 6 months, doubling the annual cost."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth paying more for a condensing tankless?",
    answer: "In most cases, yes. Condensing units cost $400–$800 more than non-condensing, but they save $100–$300 on venting (PVC vs stainless steel), qualify for the 30% IRA tax credit (saving $400–$750), and reduce annual fuel costs by $50–$200. When you add it all up, a condensing unit often costs the same or less than non-condensing after credits and venting savings."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does tankless water heater installation take?",
    answer: "A standard installation takes 4–8 hours for gas and 2–4 hours for electric. This assumes no major infrastructure changes. If gas line upgrades, new venting, or electrical panel work is needed, add half a day to a full day. Some complex parallel-unit installations take 2 days. The electrician and plumber may visit on different days for electric-to-gas conversions."
