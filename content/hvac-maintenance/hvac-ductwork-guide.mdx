HVAC ductwork is the distribution network that delivers conditioned air throughout your home, and it's responsible for more energy waste and comfort problems than most homeowners realize. ENERGY STAR reports that the average home loses 20-30% of conditioned air through duct leaks, poor connections, and inadequate insulation, costing the typical household $200-$450 per year in wasted energy.

This guide covers the three main duct types (sheet metal, flexible, and fiberboard), how ducts are properly sized using ACCA Manual D, common ductwork problems you can diagnose yourself, DIY repairs that save hundreds, and when professional ductwork services are worth the investment.

<TableOfContents />

## Types of HVAC Ductwork

There are three primary ductwork materials used in residential HVAC systems, each with distinct advantages, limitations, and cost profiles.

### Sheet Metal Ductwork

Sheet metal (galvanized steel or aluminum) is the gold standard for residential ductwork. It's durable, non-porous, and maintains its shape for decades.

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| Material | 26-gauge or 28-gauge galvanized steel (most common), aluminum |
| Shapes | Rectangular, round, or oval |
| Typical lifespan | 30-50+ years |
| Insulation | External fiberglass wrap (R-4.2 to R-8) or duct liner |
| Cost (installed) | $15-$25 per linear foot (supply), $10-$18 (return) |
| Airflow characteristics | Excellent, smooth interior minimizes friction loss |
| Noise | Can transmit blower noise; dampers may be needed |
| Mold resistance | Excellent, non-porous surface |

Sheet metal ducts come in rectangular and round cross-sections. Round ducts move 27% more air than rectangular ducts of the same cross-sectional area due to lower friction loss.

**Best for:** New construction, major duct replacements, humid climates (mold resistance), maximum longevity and performance.

### Flexible Ductwork (Flex Duct)

Flexible ductwork consists of a wire coil covered with plastic, surrounded by fiberglass insulation, and wrapped in a vapor barrier. It's the most common ductwork type in homes built after 1990.

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| Material | Plastic inner liner, fiberglass insulation, foil/plastic outer jacket |
| Shapes | Round only |
| Typical lifespan | 15-25 years |
| Insulation | Built-in (typically R-4.2 to R-8) |
| Cost (installed) | $5-$12 per linear foot |
| Airflow | Good when properly installed; poor when kinked or compressed |
| Noise | Quieter than sheet metal |
| Mold resistance | Moderate |

Flex duct is popular because it's inexpensive, easy to install, and comes pre-insulated. However, its performance is highly dependent on installation quality. Poorly installed flex duct (kinked, sagging, overly long, or compressed) can increase static pressure by 50-200%.

<Callout type="warning">
Every 90-degree turn in flex duct is equivalent to adding 15-20 feet of straight duct in friction loss. Poorly run flex duct is the number one cause of inadequate airflow to individual rooms.
</Callout>

**Best for:** Short connector runs, retrofit installations, budget-conscious projects.

### Fiberboard Ductwork

Fiberboard ductwork is made from compressed fiberglass boards with a foil outer facing.

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| Material | Compressed fiberglass board, foil-faced exterior |
| Shapes | Rectangular (fabricated on-site) |
| Typical lifespan | 15-30 years |
| Insulation | Built-in (R-4 to R-6.5) |
| Cost (installed) | $8-$18 per linear foot |
| Airflow | Moderate, fibrous interior has higher friction |
| Noise | Excellent, best sound dampening |
| Mold resistance | Poor, fibrous interior traps moisture |

Fiberboard was popular in the 1970s-1990s. Its fibrous interior traps dust that can't be fully removed and can support mold growth in humid environments, making it generally not recommended for new residential installations.

**Best for:** Applications where noise control is the primary concern.

### Ductwork Comparison Summary

| Factor | Sheet Metal | Flex Duct | Fiberboard |
|---|---|---|---|
| Durability | 30-50+ years | 15-25 years | 15-30 years |
| Airflow efficiency | Excellent | Install-dependent | Moderate |
| Cost per linear foot | $15-$25 | $5-$12 | $8-$18 |
| Noise dampening | Low | Good | Excellent |
| Mold resistance | Excellent | Moderate | Poor |
| Ease of cleaning | Excellent | Poor | Very poor |
| Installation ease | Difficult | Easy | Moderate |

## Duct Sizing: Why It Matters More Than You Think

Improperly sized ductwork is one of the most common HVAC installation defects. According to ACCA, the majority of residential duct systems are not properly designed, leading to comfort complaints, noise issues, and reduced efficiency.

### The Basics of Duct Sizing

Duct sizing is governed by ACCA Manual D, which calculates the required duct dimensions based on the CFM (cubic feet per minute) each room needs, available static pressure from the air handler, total equivalent length of each duct run (including fittings), and friction rate per 100 feet of duct.

The goal is to deliver the right amount of air to each room without exceeding the system's static pressure budget (typically 0.50 inches of water column total external static pressure).

### Common Duct Sizes and Airflow Capacity

| Round Duct Diameter | Approximate CFM (at 0.08" friction rate) | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| 4" | 30-45 CFM | Small bathroom, powder room |
| 5" | 50-70 CFM | Small bedroom |
| 6" | 75-110 CFM | Standard bedroom, small office |
| 7" | 110-155 CFM | Larger bedroom, dining room |
| 8" | 160-210 CFM | Living room, master bedroom |
| 10" | 280-375 CFM | Main trunk branch |
| 12" | 425-575 CFM | Major trunk line |
| 14" | 600-800 CFM | Main supply trunk |
| 16" | 850-1,100 CFM | Main supply trunk (larger systems) |
| 18" | 1,100-1,400 CFM | Main return trunk |
| 20" | 1,400-1,800 CFM | Main return trunk (larger systems) |

<Callout type="info">
Rule of thumb: you need approximately 1 CFM per square foot of living space for cooling. A 200 sq ft bedroom needs roughly 200 CFM, which requires a 7" or 8" round supply duct. Actual calculations should follow Manual D for precision.
</Callout>

### Undersized vs. Oversized Ducts

| Problem | Undersized Ducts | Oversized Ducts |
|---|---|---|
| Airflow | Restricted, rooms don't get enough air | Excessive, rooms get too much air |
| Noise | Loud whooshing/whistling at registers | Quiet but may have low velocity issues |
| Static pressure | Too high, strains blower motor | Too low, air may not reach far registers |
| Energy | Blower works harder, higher electric bills | Minor efficiency loss from thermal losses |
| Comfort | Hot/cold rooms, uneven temperatures | Drafty feeling, possible short cycling |
| Common cause | Installer guessing instead of using Manual D | "Bigger is better" mentality |

The most common sizing error is undersized return ducts. Many homes have significantly inadequate return air paths, which starves the system of air and creates the same problems as a clogged filter. A 3-ton AC system needs approximately 1,200 CFM of return air, requiring at least 450-600 square inches of return duct cross-section.

## Common Ductwork Problems (And How to Find Them)

Most ductwork problems can be identified with a visual inspection of accessible ducts in attics, basements, and crawlspaces.

### Problem 1: Duct Leaks

This is the single biggest ductwork issue in American homes. ENERGY STAR estimates 20-30% of conditioned air is lost through leaks. Leaks occur at joints between duct sections, connections at boots (where ducts meet registers), the supply plenum connection, the return air platform or return drop, and holes from removed or relocated ducts.

**How to find leaks:** Turn on the HVAC system, then inspect all accessible ductwork by holding a stick of incense or a smoke pencil near joints and connections. Movement in the smoke indicates a leak. You can also feel for air escaping with your hand at joints.

**DIY fix:** Apply mastic sealant (a gray, paintable paste) over all joints and connections. For gaps larger than 1/4 inch, bridge the gap with fiberglass mesh tape and coat with mastic. For smaller joints, UL-listed metal-backed foil tape is acceptable but mastic is more durable.

| Sealant Material | Durability | Ease of Application | Cost | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mastic sealant | 20+ years | Moderate (messy) | $8-$15/tub | All joints, permanent seal |
| Metal-backed foil tape | 10-15 years | Easy | $8-$12/roll | Quick repairs, small joints |
| Standard duct tape | 1-2 years | Easy | $4-$8/roll | NEVER use (despite the name) |
| Aeroseal (professional) | 20+ years | N/A (pro only) | $1,500-$3,000 | Whole-system sealing |

<Callout type="warning">
Standard "duct tape" (the gray cloth tape sold at hardware stores) is the worst possible choice for duct sealing. Despite its name, it degrades within 1-2 years from temperature cycling and loses adhesion. LBNL (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab) tested duct tape and found it failed under all conditions studied. Use mastic or UL-listed metal foil tape instead.
</Callout>

### Problem 2: Disconnected Ducts

Completely disconnected ducts are more common than you'd expect, especially in attics where flex duct can pull free from connections. A disconnected supply duct means you're dumping conditioned air directly into your attic or crawlspace while the room it serves gets no cooling or heating.

**Signs:** One room is always significantly warmer (summer) or cooler (winter) than the rest of the house. No or very weak airflow from one or more registers. Your energy bills seem high relative to your home's size and system efficiency.

**DIY fix:** Reconnect the duct and secure with a zip tie or hose clamp, then seal with mastic.

### Problem 3: Crushed or Kinked Flex Duct

Flex duct is easily damaged by stored items in attics, foot traffic during other work, and improper initial installation. A 50% compression reduces airflow by up to 75%.

**DIY fix:** Carefully straighten or reroute the duct. Support it with duct hangers (straps) every 4-5 feet to prevent sagging. The duct should maintain a smooth, gentle arc with no sharp bends.

### Problem 4: Inadequate Insulation

Ducts running through unconditioned spaces (attics, crawlspaces, garages) must be insulated. Uninsulated ducts in a 130-degree F summer attic can raise supply air temperature by 15-25 degrees F before it reaches the room.

| Duct Location | Minimum Insulation | Recommended Insulation |
|---|---|---|
| Conditioned space (finished basement) | R-0 (none needed) | R-0 |
| Unconditioned basement/crawlspace | R-4.2 | R-6 to R-8 |
| Attic (vented) | R-6 | R-8 or higher |
| Garage | R-6 | R-8 or higher |

**DIY fix:** Wrap exposed sheet metal ducts with fiberglass duct insulation (R-6 or R-8), securing with foil tape or wire. Ensure the vapor barrier faces outward (away from the duct). For flex duct, verify the existing insulation jacket is intact and not torn.

### Problem 5: Inadequate Return Air

Many homes, especially older ones, have insufficient return air paths. This is often the root cause of uneven temperatures, high static pressure, and noisy operation.

**Signs:** Doors to rooms with supply registers but no return registers "blow" closed or open when the system runs. You hear the system struggling or whistling. Some rooms are significantly warmer/cooler than others.

**Solutions range from simple to complex:** Install transfer grilles or jump ducts between rooms and the hallway to allow air to circulate back to the return ($20-$50 per room DIY). Add undercuts to bedroom doors (minimum 1-inch gap under each door). Have additional return ducts installed by a professional ($200-$500 per new return).

## Duct Design: Key Principles

If you're building a new home or having ducts replaced, understanding basic duct design principles helps you evaluate contractor proposals.

### Supply Duct Layout Types

| Layout | Description | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trunk and branch | Main trunk line with smaller branches to each room | Balanced air distribution, easy to size | Requires more material, harder to route |
| Radial (spider) | Individual runs from plenum to each room | Simple, short runs minimize losses | Requires large plenum, limited to slab homes |
| Perimeter loop | Continuous loop around the home's perimeter | Excellent for slab-on-grade, even distribution | More material, complex installation |

**Trunk and branch** is the most common residential layout and offers the best balance of performance and cost. The main trunk typically reduces in size as it moves away from the air handler, maintaining adequate air velocity as branch ducts peel off.

### Duct Location Hierarchy

Where ducts are located dramatically affects their performance. Ducts in unconditioned spaces lose significant energy regardless of insulation quality.

| Location | Energy Loss | Comfort Impact | Recommended? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inside conditioned space (ceiling soffits, interior walls) | Minimal (0-5%) | Best | Strongly recommended |
| Insulated, sealed attic (spray foam roof deck) | Low (5-10%) | Good | Good option |
| Uninsulated attic (vented) | High (15-30%) | Poor | Avoid if possible |
| Crawlspace (conditioned) | Low (5-10%) | Good | Good option |
| Crawlspace (vented) | High (15-25%) | Fair | Insulate and seal ducts |
| Garage (unconditioned) | High (15-30%) | Poor | Avoid if possible |

<Callout type="tip">
If you're building new or doing a major renovation, insist on ductwork within the conditioned envelope of your home (interior walls, chases, conditioned attic). This single design decision can save 15-25% on heating and cooling costs compared to attic-mounted ducts, and it eliminates the duct sealing and insulation headaches that plague most homes.
</Callout>

## DIY Duct Repairs and Improvements

Several ductwork improvements are well within DIY capability and offer significant returns.

### Sealing Leaky Ducts (DIY)

**Materials:** Mastic sealant ($8-$15), fiberglass mesh tape ($5-$10), disposable gloves, putty knife or old paint brush.

**Process:** With the system running, locate leaks by feel or with a smoke pencil. Apply a thick coat of mastic over every joint, seam, and connection in accessible ductwork. For gaps larger than 1/4 inch, press fiberglass mesh tape into the wet mastic and apply a second coat over the tape. Allow 24 hours to dry.

**Expected savings:** 10-20% reduction in heating and cooling costs, depending on baseline leakage.

### Insulating Exposed Ducts (DIY)

**Materials:** R-6 or R-8 fiberglass duct wrap ($30-$60 per roll, covers approximately 50-75 linear feet), foil tape ($8-$12), utility knife.

**Process:** Wrap insulation around the duct with the vapor barrier (foil face) on the outside. Secure with foil tape at the seam and every 12 inches. Overlap seams by 2 inches. Don't compress the insulation, as this reduces its R-value.

**Expected savings:** 5-15% reduction in energy costs for ducts in unconditioned spaces.

### Adding Transfer Grilles (DIY)

**Materials:** Transfer grille kit ($15-$30), drywall saw, pencil.

**Process:** Install a transfer grille in the wall between a bedroom and the hallway, near the ceiling. This allows return air to flow from the bedroom back to the central return register even when the door is closed. This balances pressure and prevents rooms from becoming positive-pressure zones that resist supply air delivery.

**Expected improvement:** Better temperature balance in closed rooms, reduced static pressure, quieter operation.

## Professional Duct Services and Costs

Some ductwork problems require professional equipment and expertise.

| Service | Cost Range | When Needed |
|---|---|---|
| Duct leakage testing (duct blaster) | $150-$350 | Before and after sealing to quantify improvement |
| Professional duct sealing (manual) | $400-$1,200 | Accessible ducts with significant leakage |
| Aeroseal duct sealing | $1,500-$3,000 | Inaccessible ducts, severe leakage, verified by testing |
| Partial duct replacement | $500-$2,500 | Damaged or deteriorated sections |
| Full duct replacement | $3,000-$10,000+ | End-of-life ductwork, major remodel, system replacement |
| Duct cleaning | $300-$600 | Only when contamination is confirmed |
| Duct design (Manual D) | $200-$500 | New construction, additions, system replacement |
| Zoning system installation | $2,000-$5,000 | Multi-story homes with temperature imbalance |

### When to Replace vs. Repair

| Condition | Repair or Replace? | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| A few leaky joints | Repair (seal) | Mastic sealing costs $15-$50 DIY |
| Disconnected flex duct | Repair (reconnect) | Simple fix, $10-$30 in materials |
| Crushed/damaged flex duct (one section) | Replace section | $20-$80 for new flex and fittings |
| Flex duct with torn vapor barrier | Replace section | Compromised insulation won't recover |
| Sheet metal with minor rust | Repair (seal + paint) | Surface rust doesn't affect function |
| Sheet metal with holes/perforations | Replace section | Patch or replace the damaged section |
| Fiberboard with mold growth | Replace | Mold can't be fully removed from fiberboard |
| System-wide severe leakage (>30%) | Consider replacement | If ducts are old, replacement may be more cost-effective than sealing |
| Major renovation/addition | Replace or extend | Match new layout with properly sized ducts |

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: DIY Duct Sealing Saves $340/Year

A homeowner in Atlanta noticed 8-10 degree F temperature differences between upstairs and downstairs. An energy audit revealed 35% duct leakage in the attic ductwork. Over a weekend, they sealed every accessible joint with mastic sealant (total material cost: $45). Their energy bills dropped by approximately $340/year. The payback period was less than 2 months.

### Example 2: Disconnected Duct Discovered After 3 Years

A homeowner in Sacramento wondered why one bedroom was always 8 degrees warmer than the rest of the house in summer. They had tried closing registers in other rooms, adding a portable AC unit ($350), and even questioned whether the AC was sized correctly. Finally, an HVAC technician checked the attic and found the flex duct to that bedroom had completely disconnected from the trunk line. Reconnecting and sealing it took 20 minutes and solved the problem instantly.

### Example 3: Aeroseal Fixes What Manual Sealing Can't

A 1960s ranch home in Denver had sheet metal ductwork embedded in a concrete slab (a common construction method for that era). Duct blaster testing revealed 45% leakage, but the ducts were completely inaccessible for manual sealing. Professional Aeroseal treatment ($2,200) injected aerosolized sealant particles into the pressurized duct system, sealing leaks from the inside. Post-treatment testing showed leakage reduced to 8%. Annual heating and cooling savings: approximately $450, with a payback period of about 5 years.

### Example 4: Duct Redesign Solves Chronic Comfort Problem

A two-story home in Chicago had constant temperature imbalance: 72 degrees F downstairs and 78 degrees F upstairs during summer. The original ductwork used a single-zone system with undersized supply runs to the second floor. An HVAC contractor designed and installed a two-zone system with new properly sized ductwork to the second floor ($4,500). Temperature difference between floors dropped to 1-2 degrees F, and the family stopped running window AC units in the upstairs bedrooms (previously spending $200/summer on the window units).

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What type of ductwork is best for residential HVAC?",
    answer: "Sheet metal (galvanized steel) is the best overall choice for residential ductwork. It lasts 30-50+ years, resists mold growth, has the lowest airflow friction, and can be thoroughly cleaned. Its main drawbacks are higher cost ($15-$25/linear foot installed vs. $5-$12 for flex) and more complex installation. Flex duct is acceptable for short connector runs (under 15 feet) between trunk lines and registers when properly supported and stretched taut. For new construction, invest in sheet metal for trunk lines and branches, using flex only for final connections."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my ductwork is leaking?",
    answer: "Common signs include: high energy bills relative to your home size and system efficiency, rooms that are always too hot or too cold, excessive dust in the house despite regular filter changes, the HVAC system running longer than expected to reach temperature, and visible dust streaks around duct joints in the attic or crawlspace. For definitive testing, an HVAC contractor can perform a duct blaster test ($150-$350) that precisely measures total leakage as a percentage of airflow. Anything above 15% is considered excessive, and the average home tests at 20-30%."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I seal my own ductwork?",
    answer: "Yes, sealing accessible ductwork with mastic is one of the best DIY projects for energy savings. You need mastic sealant ($8-$15), fiberglass mesh tape ($5-$10), and disposable gloves. Apply mastic to every joint, seam, and connection you can reach. The process is messy but straightforward. However, you can only seal what you can access, and much of your ductwork may be hidden in walls, ceilings, or floors. For inaccessible ducts, professional Aeroseal treatment ($1,500-$3,000) seals from the inside."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does HVAC ductwork last?",
    answer: "Sheet metal ductwork lasts 30-50+ years with minimal maintenance. The metal itself doesn't degrade, though insulation and sealants may need refreshing after 15-20 years. Flex duct typically lasts 15-25 years before the inner liner and insulation degrade. Fiberboard ductwork lasts 15-30 years. The most common end-of-life indicator for all duct types is excessive leakage that can't be cost-effectively repaired. If your ducts are original to a home built before 1990, they may be due for inspection and possible replacement."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I replace flex duct with sheet metal?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. Properly installed flex duct performs well for short runs (under 15 feet) with gentle bends and adequate support. Replacement is warranted when flex duct is severely kinked, compressed, or damaged; when inner liners are torn or deteriorated; when runs are excessively long (20+ feet) or have sharp bends; or when you're replacing the HVAC system anyway. If your flex duct is in good condition, properly supported, and runs are short, it's fine to keep it."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Manual D and why does it matter?",
    answer: "ACCA Manual D is the industry standard procedure for residential duct design. It calculates the correct duct sizes based on each room's heating and cooling load (from Manual J), the available static pressure of your equipment, the layout and length of duct runs, and fitting equivalent lengths. Without Manual D calculations, duct sizing is essentially guesswork. Most comfort complaints (hot/cold rooms, noise, high bills) trace back to ducts that were sized by rules of thumb rather than proper engineering. Insist on Manual D calculations for any new duct installation."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to replace ductwork?",
    answer: "Full ductwork replacement costs $3,000-$10,000+ depending on home size, duct material chosen, accessibility, and local labor rates. Partial replacement of damaged sections typically costs $500-$2,500. For a 2,000 sq ft home with accessible attic ductwork, expect approximately $5,000-$7,000 for a complete replacement with new sheet metal trunk lines and flex branch connections, including insulation and sealing. This is often done in conjunction with HVAC system replacement to ensure the entire system is properly matched."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is my ductwork sweating or dripping?",
    answer: "Condensation on ductwork occurs when the cold duct surface temperature drops below the dew point of the surrounding air. This happens most often with supply ducts in humid unconditioned spaces like attics and crawlspaces. The fix is ensuring adequate duct insulation (minimum R-6, preferably R-8) with an intact vapor barrier facing outward. Torn or missing insulation allows humid air to contact the cold duct surface. If insulation is intact and sweating persists, your space may have a humidity problem requiring dehumidification or improved ventilation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I add ductwork to a room that doesn't have it?",
    answer: "Yes, but it's not a simple DIY project. Adding a duct run requires verifying your existing system has capacity to serve the additional room (Manual J/D calculations), routing new ductwork from the nearest trunk line to the new room, installing a register/grille, and potentially adding a return air path. Professional installation costs $500-$2,000 per room depending on complexity and routing. Alternatives for rooms without ductwork include ductless mini-splits ($3,000-$5,000 installed) or high-velocity small-duct systems."
  },
  {
    question: "Should ductwork be inside or outside the conditioned space?",
    answer: "Inside the conditioned space whenever possible. Ducts in unconditioned attics and crawlspaces lose 15-30% of their conditioned air through thermal losses and leaks, even with good insulation. Ducts within the conditioned envelope (interior walls, ceiling soffits, conditioned basements) experience minimal losses (0-5%). If attic ducts are unavoidable, converting to a conditioned attic (spray foam on the roof deck) brings the ducts inside the thermal boundary and can reduce losses by 75% or more."
