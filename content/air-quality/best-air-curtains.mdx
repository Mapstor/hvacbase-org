# Best Air Curtains for Commercial & Residential Use in 2026

The Mars Air Systems LoPro Series is the best commercial air curtain in 2026, delivering 1,200-2,400 FPM (feet per minute) air velocity across door widths up to 72 inches with a slim 5-inch profile that fits above standard commercial doorframes. For residential use, the Awoco FM1509 provides effective insect and air barrier protection for standard 36-inch doorways at under $200.

An air curtain creates an invisible barrier of high-velocity air across an open doorway, separating indoor and outdoor environments without a physical door. They reduce HVAC energy loss by 70-80% through open doors, block flying insects, prevent dust and pollution infiltration, and maintain indoor temperature zones—all while allowing unrestricted foot and vehicle traffic.

## How Air Curtains Work

An air curtain is a fan-powered unit mounted above (or beside) a doorway that blows a continuous stream of air downward across the opening. This air stream creates a pressure barrier that resists the mixing of indoor and outdoor air.

The effectiveness depends on three factors: air velocity (speed of the stream, measured in FPM), air volume (total CFM of airflow), and discharge angle (typically 15-20 degrees toward the outdoor side for optimal separation).

When properly sized and installed, an air curtain maintains 70-80% of the temperature differential between inside and outside, compared to 0% with a wide-open door and 100% with a closed door.

**Best for:** Retail stores, restaurants, office lobbies, hospitals, any commercial entrance requiring insect and climate barrier.

### 2. Berner Sanitation Certified — Best for Food Service

Berner's Sanitation Certified line is specifically designed for USDA/FDA-compliant food processing and service environments. The high-velocity output (up to 2,800 FPM) creates a barrier strong enough to meet health department insect exclusion requirements. NSF certified for food service applications.

**Best for:** Commercial kitchens, food processing facilities, restaurant service doors, loading docks where food safety compliance is required.

### 3. Awoco FM1509 — Best Residential Value

The FM1509 delivers commercial-grade 1,100 FPM air velocity in a residential-friendly package at under $200. It covers standard 36-inch doorways and installs with basic mounting brackets. Two-speed operation lets you balance effectiveness with noise (58 dB on high is noticeable but acceptable).

**Best for:** Residential front/back doors, garage-to-house doorways, home workshops, residential kitchens with exterior doors, and insect barrier needs.

## Sizing an Air Curtain for Your Doorway

The critical sizing factor is door height, not width. Air velocity must be sufficient to maintain the barrier from the unit (mounted at the top) down to the floor. Taller doors need faster air velocity.

  title="Minimum Air Velocity by Door Height"
  headers={["Door Height", "Unheated Min Velocity", "Heated Min Velocity", "High Wind Exposure"]}
  rows={[
    ["7 ft (standard residential)", "600 FPM", "700 FPM", "900-1,200 FPM"],
    ["8 ft (standard commercial)", "700 FPM", "900 FPM", "1,200-1,500 FPM"],
    ["10 ft (tall commercial)", "1,000 FPM", "1,200 FPM", "1,600-2,000 FPM"],

/>

**Width matching:** The air curtain should be at least as wide as the door opening. For doors wider than the largest single unit, use multiple units side by side or a custom-width commercial model.

## Installation Basics

**Mounting position:** Directly above the door opening, on the interior side. The unit should be as close to the top of the opening as possible—every inch of gap between the unit and the door header reduces effectiveness.

**Discharge angle:** Most units are factory-set to 15-20 degrees toward the exterior. This slight outward angle pushes infiltrating air back before it enters the space. Do not change this angle unless instructed by the manufacturer.

**Electrical requirements:** Commercial units typically require 208-240V dedicated circuits. Heated models may need 30-50A circuits. Residential models run on standard 120V/15A circuits. Always verify electrical requirements before purchase.

## Real-World Air Curtain Applications

### Example 1: Busy Restaurant Entrance

A restaurant with a front door opening 50-80 times per hour during dinner service. Mars Air LoPro LP236 installed above the 36-inch entrance. Result: indoor temperature fluctuation reduced from 8-12 degrees F (no curtain) to 2-3 degrees F. Flying insect complaints dropped to near zero. HVAC energy savings estimated at 30% during peak service hours.

### Example 2: Residential Garage Door to House

A homeowner in Texas with a garage-to-kitchen doorway that stays open frequently. Awoco FM1509 mounted above the interior doorway. Result: kitchen temperature stabilized (previously fluctuated 5-8 degrees when garage door was open). Garage fumes, dust, and insects blocked from entering the kitchen.

### Example 3: Commercial Loading Dock

A distribution warehouse with a 12×14 ft loading dock that stays open during receiving. Berner High Performance unit delivering 2,400 FPM across the opening. Result: climate separation maintained at 75% effectiveness, cold storage temperature compliance maintained during unloading, and insect control for food safety compliance.

### Example 4: Drive-Through Window

A fast-food restaurant drive-through window (4 ft opening). Curtron AP-2 mini air curtain at 800 FPM. Result: conditioned air loss through the window reduced by 60%. Employee comfort improved. Flying insects from the drive-through lane blocked from entering the kitchen.

## Energy Savings and ROI

Air curtains pay for themselves through HVAC energy savings when installed on frequently opened doors.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "Do air curtains really work?",
    answer: "Yes. Properly sized and installed air curtains maintain 70-80% of the temperature differential across an open doorway. Independent studies show 30-70% reduction in HVAC energy loss through doorways. They also effectively block flying insects (USDA-certified models achieve 99%+ insect exclusion). The key is proper sizing — the air velocity must be sufficient for the door height."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use an air curtain at home?",
    answer: "Yes. Residential air curtains ($120-300) install above standard doorways and run on standard 120V outlets. They're most useful for: garage-to-house doorways (block fumes, heat, cold), back doors kept open for pets, screened porches with frequent entry, and any door opened frequently where insects or temperature control is a concern."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does an air curtain cost to run?",
    answer: "Unheated residential models draw 100-300 watts — roughly $12-36/year running 8 hours/day at $0.17/kWh. Commercial unheated models draw 200-800 watts ($25-100/year). Heated models consume significantly more — 2,000-10,000+ watts depending on size, adding $240-1,200+/year. The energy cost is typically offset by HVAC savings from reduced air infiltration."
  },
  {
    question: "What size air curtain do I need?",
    answer: "Match the unit width to your door width (at minimum). For door height, check the manufacturer's velocity rating against our sizing table: 7-8 ft doors need 600-900 FPM minimum, 10-12 ft doors need 1,000-1,600 FPM, and 14+ ft doors need 1,800+ FPM. Wind exposure increases requirements by 30-50%. When in doubt, size up — an oversized curtain can be turned down, but an undersized one can't be boosted."
  },
  {
    question: "Do air curtains keep bugs out?",
    answer: "Yes — air curtains are one of the most effective insect barriers for open doorways. USDA-certified models (like the Berner Sanitation Certified line) achieve 99%+ insect exclusion. The high-velocity air stream creates a barrier that flying insects cannot penetrate. This is why air curtains are standard equipment in food processing, restaurants, and grocery stores."
  },
  {
    question: "Air curtain vs. screen door: which is better?",
    answer: "Air curtains allow unrestricted foot and vehicle traffic with no physical barrier to open, maintain, or replace. Screen doors physically block insects but impede traffic flow and wear out. Air curtains also provide climate separation (temperature, humidity) that screen doors don't. For high-traffic commercial doors, air curtains are clearly superior. For residential doors opened a few times per day, screen doors are more economical."
  },
  {
    question: "Can air curtains replace doors?",
    answer: "Air curtains cannot fully replace doors for security, sound isolation, or complete thermal separation. They maintain 70-80% of temperature differential — not 100%. For security, they provide no barrier. For sound, minimal reduction. Air curtains supplement doors (keeping climate separation during open periods) or serve as the primary barrier in commercial settings where doors would impede traffic (loading docks, drive-throughs, retail entrances)."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I install a residential air curtain?",
    answer: "Mount the unit above the doorway on the interior side using the included brackets. The bottom of the unit should be as close to the top of the door frame as possible. Most residential models weigh 15-30 lbs and mount with standard screws into wall studs or header. Plug into a standard 120V outlet (ensure the circuit can handle the wattage). Aim the discharge slightly outward (15-20 degrees) — most units are factory-set."
