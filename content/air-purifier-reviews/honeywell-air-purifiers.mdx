# Honeywell Air Purifiers: Brand Review (7 Models Compared for 2026)

Honeywell is one of the most recognized names in HVAC, and their air purifiers deliver solid, no-nonsense True HEPA filtration backed by AHAM-verified CADR ratings. The flagship HPA300 ($249, 300 CADR, 465 sq ft) has been a large-room workhorse for years and remains a reliable choice. However, Honeywell's lineup is showing its age in 2026 — no smart app connectivity, no air quality sensors, and higher filter costs than nimbler competitors like Levoit and Winix.

If you already trust the Honeywell brand from your thermostat, HVAC system, or other home products, their purifiers won't let you down on filtration. But if you're comparing features dollar-for-dollar, Levoit, Coway, and Winix all offer more value at similar or lower prices. Honeywell's strength is brand recognition and retail availability — you can find their purifiers at virtually every Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target.

## Honeywell Filtration Technology

All current Honeywell air purifiers use True HEPA filtration that captures 99.97% of particles at 0.3 microns. The filter system is straightforward: a carbon pre-filter for odors and large particles, followed by a cylindrical True HEPA filter for fine particulate removal.

Honeywell's HEPA filters use a pleated cylindrical design that maximizes surface area within a compact housing. The quality of the HEPA media is solid — these are genuine H13-grade filters with AHAM-verified performance. Where Honeywell falls behind is the activated carbon: their pre-filters use a thin carbon-impregnated mesh rather than granular carbon, providing minimal odor and VOC removal compared to brands like Alen or even Coway.

<Callout type="info">
**Honeywell's Legacy Advantage:** Honeywell has been manufacturing air filtration products for HVAC systems for over 100 years. Their residential air purifier line benefits from this deep filtration expertise. The HEPA media and filter construction are among the most consistent in the industry, even if the smart features and design lag behind newer brands.

## Model Highlights

### HPA300: The Large-Room Workhorse

The HPA300 is Honeywell's most powerful purifier at 300 CADR covering 465 sq ft. It uses three cylindrical HEPA filters arranged side-by-side for maximum surface area and airflow. This multi-filter design is one reason the HPA300 delivers strong CADR, but it also means replacement costs are higher — you need three HEPA filters plus a carbon pre-filter at each change.

At $249, the HPA300 competes directly with the Levoit Core 600S ($249, 410 CADR), and that comparison doesn't favor Honeywell. The Levoit offers 37% more CADR, a smart app, and lower filter costs. The HPA300's advantages are pure build quality, AHAM-verified reliability, and massive retail availability.

The HPA300 is also notoriously loud on high speed — 63 dB is louder than normal conversation and significantly noisier than the Levoit Core 600S (55 dB) or Coway Airmega 400 (52 dB) at max speed. On low speed (29 dB), it's reasonable for daytime use but not the quietest bedroom option.

### InSight Series: Basic Air Quality Indication

The InSight models (HPA250B, HPA5300B, HPA5150B) add a colored LED air quality indicator that shows green, yellow, or red based on detected particle levels. This is the closest Honeywell gets to smart monitoring — there is no app, no PM2.5 reading, and no historical data. It is better than nothing but far behind what Levoit, Coway, or Blueair offer.

### HPA020B: Budget Tabletop

At $89, the HPA020B is a compact tabletop purifier for small spaces (75 sq ft) like desks, nightstands, or small bathrooms. CADR of 60 CFM is very low — this is a supplemental device, not a room-scale purifier. It uses the same True HEPA technology but in a significantly smaller package.

## Real-World Performance Testing

### Example 1: HPA300 in a 450 sq ft Living Room

A homeowner in Philadelphia, PA ran the HPA300 in their 450 sq ft living room. Baseline PM2.5 was 16 µg/m³. On the highest of three speeds, PM2.5 dropped to 3 µg/m³ within 20 minutes — impressive for the rated coverage area.

However, at 63 dB on high, the unit was disruptively loud. The homeowner typically ran it on medium (approximately 48 dB) during the day and low (29 dB) at night. On medium speed, PM2.5 maintained at 5–8 µg/m³, and on low, it crept up to 8–12 µg/m³ overnight.

The three-filter design meant replacement costs were steep: approximately $70–$90 per year for three HEPA filters plus a carbon pre-filter. The homeowner later switched to a Levoit Core 600S and reported better air quality, lower noise, and lower filter costs.

### Example 2: HPA250B InSight in a Bedroom

A user in Dallas, TX placed the HPA250B in their 280 sq ft bedroom. The colored air quality indicator was the primary "smart" feature, turning green after about 30 minutes of operation. PM2.5 (measured with a separate Temtop monitor) maintained at 3–5 µg/m³ on medium speed.

On low speed, noise at 29 dB was adequate for sleeping — not as quiet as a Blueair 411i+ (18 dB) or Levoit Core 300S (24 dB), but tolerable. The InSight indicator provided basic reassurance but the user wished for actual PM2.5 numbers and an app.

### Example 3: Two HPA100 Units for a Townhouse

A couple in Columbus, OH purchased two HPA100 units ($298 total) for their 1,100 sq ft townhouse — one upstairs and one downstairs. Each unit covered approximately 155 sq ft effectively, keeping PM2.5 at 4–6 µg/m³ in the immediate areas.

The approach worked for the rooms where units were placed but provided minimal benefit to adjacent rooms. For whole-home coverage on the same budget, two Levoit Core 300S units ($198) or one Coway Airmega 400 ($350) would have been more effective.

### Example 4: HPA300 During Wildfire Smoke

A homeowner in Sacramento, CA relied on the HPA300 during a five-day wildfire smoke event (outdoor AQI 180+). Running on high speed continuously, it maintained indoor PM2.5 at 10–18 µg/m³. The noise at 63 dB made it unbearable for extended use, so they alternated between high and medium speed.

The carbon pre-filter provided virtually no smoke odor removal due to its thin design. The homeowner supplemented with wet towels over the intake to capture some odor — a clear sign that the HPA300's carbon filtration is insufficient for smoke.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is Honeywell a good air purifier brand?",
      answer: "Honeywell makes reliable, AHAM-verified True HEPA air purifiers backed by over 100 years of filtration expertise. Their build quality is solid, and you can find them at virtually every major retailer. However, the lineup lacks smart features, produces more noise than competitors, and carries higher filter costs relative to CADR output. In 2026, newer brands like Levoit, Coway, and Winix offer better overall value."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the Honeywell HPA300 still worth buying in 2026?",
      answer: "The HPA300 ($249, 300 CADR) remains a functional large-room purifier, but the Levoit Core 600S ($249, 410 CADR) offers 37% more CADR, a smart app, lower noise, and cheaper filters at the same price. The HPA300's advantages are Honeywell's brand reputation and wide retail availability. For online shoppers comparing specs, the Levoit is the better buy."
    },
    {
      question: "Why don't Honeywell air purifiers have Wi-Fi or apps?",
      answer: "Honeywell's consumer air purifier line has not been updated with smart connectivity features. The company's focus appears to be on their commercial and HVAC product lines. If smart features are important, consider Levoit (VeSync app), Coway (IoCare app), or Winix (Winix Smart app) as alternatives with similar or better filtration."
    },
    {
      question: "How loud is the Honeywell HPA300?",
      answer: "The HPA300 is one of the louder air purifiers on the market: 29 dB on low (acceptable for daytime use), approximately 48 dB on medium, and 63 dB on high (louder than conversation). For comparison, the Levoit Core 600S maxes at 55 dB and the Coway Airmega 400 at 52 dB. If noise sensitivity is a concern, especially for bedrooms, other brands are quieter."
    },
    {
      question: "How often do Honeywell filters need replacing?",
      answer: "HEPA filters should be replaced every 12 months. Carbon pre-filters need replacement every 3 months. The HPA300 requires three HEPA filters per change, making it more expensive than single-filter purifiers. Total annual filter cost ranges from $45 to $90 depending on model."
    },
    {
      question: "Are third-party Honeywell filters any good?",
      answer: "Yes. Third-party HEPA filters for Honeywell purifiers are widely available at 30–50% savings over genuine Honeywell filters. For the HPA300 especially, third-party three-packs can reduce annual filter costs from $70–$90 to $40–$55. Look for H13-grade True HEPA filters from reputable Amazon sellers with strong reviews."
    },
    {
      question: "Honeywell vs Levoit: Which brand is better?",
      answer: "Levoit is the better choice in 2026 for most buyers. Levoit offers higher CADR per dollar, smart app connectivity, lower noise, lower filter costs, and ENERGY STAR certification across the lineup. Honeywell's advantages are retail store availability, brand recognition, and proven long-term reliability. If you prefer buying in-store and trust the Honeywell name, it's still a solid choice."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Honeywell remove smoke odors?",
      answer: "Honeywell purifiers effectively remove smoke particles through their True HEPA filters but are weak at removing smoke odors. The thin carbon pre-filter is designed for light odor control and is insufficient for heavy smoke smell. For smoke odor removal, look at Alen BreatheSmart with the Smoke filter (4 lbs of carbon) or IQAir HealthPro Plus (5 lbs of carbon)."
    },
    {
      question: "Which Honeywell air purifier is best for allergies?",
      answer: "The HPA300 ($249) is the best Honeywell for allergies due to its highest CADR (300 CFM) and largest coverage area (465 sq ft). All Honeywell models use True HEPA that captures 99.97% of pollen, dust mites, mold spores, and pet dander. However, for allergy sufferers specifically, the Levoit Core 600S offers 37% more CADR at the same price with a dedicated Pet Allergy filter option."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use a Honeywell air purifier in a large open room?",
      answer: "The HPA300 covers up to 465 sq ft, which handles most single rooms but may struggle in large open-concept spaces over 500 sq ft. For larger areas, consider the Coway Airmega 400 (1,560 sq ft coverage) or Alen BreatheSmart 75i (1,300 sq ft) instead. Running two smaller Honeywell units is an option but doubles both cost and noise."
