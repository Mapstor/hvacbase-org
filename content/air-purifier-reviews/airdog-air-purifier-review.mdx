# Airdog X5 Review: Innovative TPA Technology — Worth It in 2026?

The Airdog X5 ($469, 290 CADR, 800 sq ft) promises something no HEPA purifier can: zero replacement filter costs. Its TPA (Two-Pole Active) ionic field technology uses washable metal collecting plates instead of disposable filters, claiming to eliminate the $40–$170 annual filter expense that every HEPA brand charges. Over 5 years, Airdog claims you'll save $500–$1,000 in filters versus traditional purifiers.

The catch? TPA technology produces measurable ozone as a byproduct — more than gentle ionizers but within CARB safety limits. And while the collecting plates are washable, they require regular cleaning every 2–4 weeks. If you keep up with cleaning, Airdog delivers genuine cost savings. If you don't, performance degrades significantly.

<TableOfContents />

## TPA (Two-Pole Active) Technology Explained

### How It Works

Airdog's TPA technology is an advanced electrostatic precipitator working in two stages:

**Stage 1 — Ionization:** Incoming air passes through a high-voltage ionization wire that gives particles a strong positive electrical charge. This ionization is more powerful than the gentle ionizers in Coway or Winix purifiers.

**Stage 2 — Collection:** Charged particles are attracted to negatively charged metal collecting plates — a stack of flat metal fins that act like a magnet for charged particles. Particles stick to the metal plates and are removed from the air.

The collecting plates are the key innovation. Instead of disposable HEPA filter media, Airdog traps particles on washable metal surfaces. When the plates get dirty, you remove them, wash in the sink or dishwasher, dry, and reinstall.

<Callout type="warning">
**Ozone Consideration:** Airdog's TPA technology produces more ozone than gentle ionizers (Coway, Winix) because it uses a stronger ionization field. All Airdog models are CARB-certified (below 0.05 ppm), but measured levels are typically 0.01–0.03 ppm. If you have respiratory sensitivities or prefer zero ozone, HEPA is the safer choice.

### Airdog X5: The Flagship

The X5 ($469, 290 CADR, 800 sq ft) is Airdog's primary residential model with Wi-Fi, auto mode, PM2.5 sensor, and washable TPA collecting plates. At $469, it's priced between the Coway Airmega 400 ($350) and Alen BreatheSmart 75i ($469). The savings come from zero filter costs over time.

### Airdog X3: The Compact

The X3 ($329, 180 CADR, 400 sq ft) covers bedrooms and medium rooms. Same TPA technology in a smaller body. Competes with the Coway Airmega 250S ($300).

## Real-World Performance Testing

### Example 1: Airdog X5 — Diligent Cleaning

A homeowner in Sacramento, CA tested the X5 in their 650 sq ft living room, washing plates every two weeks. With clean plates, PM2.5 dropped from 14 µg/m³ to 2–4 µg/m³ within 20 minutes — comparable to HEPA purifiers of similar CADR.

**6-month cost:** $0 filters + $22 electricity = $22 total vs. $53 for Coway Airmega 400.

### Example 2: Airdog X3 — Inconsistent Cleaning

A renter in Phoenix, AZ only cleaned plates monthly instead of bi-weekly. After 3 months, PM2.5 during operation crept from 2 µg/m³ (clean) to 6–8 µg/m³. When switching to bi-weekly cleaning, performance returned. TPA requires discipline.

### Example 3: X5 vs. Coway Airmega 400 Head-to-Head

A reviewer ran both simultaneously in identical 400 sq ft rooms:
- Coway Airmega 400: PM2.5 reduced to 2 µg/m³ (from 18)  
- Airdog X5 (clean plates): PM2.5 reduced to 3 µg/m³ (from 18)

Performance was comparable. Coway won on: zero maintenance, zero ozone, $119 lower purchase price. Airdog won on: zero filter costs going forward.

### Example 4: X5 in a Smoker's Apartment

TPA effectively captured smoke particles (PM2.5 from 35 to under 5 µg/m³ within 25 minutes). However, TPA has no carbon filtration — smoke smell lingered. For smoke odor, HEPA with heavy carbon (Alen, IQAir) is significantly better.

## Long-Term Cost Analysis

<ComparisonTable
  title="5-Year Total Cost of Ownership"
  headers={["Purifier", "Purchase", "Filters (5 yrs)", "Electricity (5 yrs)", "Total 5-Year", "Monthly"]}
  rows={[
    ["Airdog X5", "$469", "$0", "$108", "$577", "$9.62"],
    ["Airdog X3", "$329", "$0", "$84", "$413", "$6.88"],
    ["Coway Airmega 400", "$350", "$225", "$114", "$689", "$11.48"],
    ["Levoit Core 600S", "$249", "$250", "$96", "$595", "$9.92"],
    ["Winix 5500-2", "$160", "$200", "$84", "$444", "$7.40"]
  ]}
/>

Airdog's zero filter cost makes it competitive over 5+ years. The X5 ($577 total) undercuts Coway ($689) and matches Levoit ($595). Over 10 years, the advantage compounds significantly.

<Callout type="important">
**The Hidden Cost:** Airdog's maintenance requires 30–60 minutes per month. If your time is worth $30/hour, that's $180–$360/year in labor — exceeding filter savings. Airdog's advantage only works if you value maintenance time at near-zero.
</Callout>

## Who Should Buy an Airdog?

**Airdog is right for you if:**
- You want to eliminate recurring filter costs permanently
- You don't mind hands-on maintenance every 2 weeks
- You plan to own for 5+ years
- You're comfortable with low-level ozone production
- You don't need VOC or odor removal (no carbon filter)

**Airdog is NOT right for you if:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Does Airdog TPA technology actually work?",
      answer: "Yes. TPA (Two-Pole Active) electrostatic precipitation is proven technology used in commercial and industrial air cleaning for decades. Airdog's residential implementation effectively captures particles when the collecting plates are clean. Performance degrades as plates get dirty — regular cleaning every 2 weeks is essential to maintain stated CADR."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Airdog produce ozone?",
      answer: "Yes. TPA's ionization stage produces measurable ozone at approximately 0.01–0.03 ppm — more than gentle ionizers (Coway, Winix at 0.001–0.003 ppm) but below the CARB safety limit of 0.05 ppm. All Airdog models are CARB-certified. If you're sensitive to ozone or prefer zero production, choose a mechanical HEPA purifier without ionization."
    },
    {
      question: "How often do I need to clean Airdog collecting plates?",
      answer: "Airdog recommends cleaning every 2 weeks for optimal performance. In high-pollution environments, weekly cleaning may be necessary. Cleaning involves removing the plate assembly, washing with warm soapy water or placing in a dishwasher (top rack), and drying completely before reinstalling. Expect 20–30 minutes per cleaning session."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Airdog better than a HEPA air purifier?",
      answer: "Not necessarily 'better' — different trade-offs. Airdog eliminates filter costs but requires regular maintenance and produces some ozone. HEPA is maintenance-free (just replace filters annually) and produces zero ozone. For pure particle removal with clean plates, performance is comparable. HEPA is better for VOC/odor removal (Airdog has no carbon filter)."
    },
    {
      question: "Airdog X5 vs Coway Airmega 400: Which should I buy?",
      answer: "Coway for: hands-off operation, zero ozone, proven HEPA technology, smart app with air quality data. Airdog for: eliminating filter costs, long-term savings over 5+ years, if you don't mind bi-weekly cleaning. Coway is $119 cheaper upfront but costs $40–$50/year in filters. After about 3 years, Airdog's total cost becomes lower."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Airdog remove odors?",
      answer: "No. Airdog's TPA technology captures particles only — there's no activated carbon filter for VOCs, odors, or gases. If you need smoke odor removal, cooking smell reduction, or chemical filtration, choose a HEPA purifier with a substantial carbon bed (Alen Smoke filter, IQAir V5-Cell, or Coway with carbon pre-filter)."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Airdog's CADR compare to HEPA purifiers?",
      answer: "The X5's 290 CADR is competitive with mid-range HEPA models but lower than the Levoit Core 600S (410 CADR) or Coway Airmega 400 (350 CADR) at similar prices. The X3's 180 CADR is comparable to budget HEPA models. TPA's advantage isn't higher CADR — it's zero filter cost over time."
    },
    {
      question: "What warranty does Airdog offer?",
      answer: "Airdog provides a 2-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects. This is comparable to Levoit and Dyson (2 years) but shorter than Coway (3 years), Honeywell (5 years), IQAir (10 years), or Alen (lifetime). Given the higher purchase price, a longer warranty would be reassuring."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Airdog good for allergies?",
      answer: "Yes. When plates are clean, Airdog's TPA captures allergens (pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold spores) at rates comparable to H13 HEPA — Airdog claims 99.97% at 0.0146 microns. The key is maintaining clean plates; dirty plates significantly reduce capture efficiency. For severe allergies, HEPA's consistent performance may be preferable."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use Airdog 24/7?",
      answer: "Yes. Airdog is designed for continuous operation. Running 24/7 will require more frequent plate cleaning (weekly rather than bi-weekly) as more particles accumulate. The ozone produced during operation is within safety limits for continuous exposure, though some users prefer running it during occupied hours only."
