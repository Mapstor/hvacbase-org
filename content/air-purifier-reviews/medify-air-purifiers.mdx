# Medify Air Purifiers: Brand Review (MA-40, MA-25, MA-14 and More for 2026)

Medify Air has carved out a strong niche by offering medical-grade H13 HEPA filtration with higher CADR-per-dollar ratios than most mid-range competitors. The MA-40 ($349, 330 CADR, 840 sq ft) and MA-25 ($199, 250 CADR, 500 sq ft) both feature dual air intake, H13 HEPA with ionizer, and AHAM-verified performance that competes with brands costing significantly more. Their flagship MA-112 pushes CADR to an impressive 500+ CFM for massive spaces.

Medify positions themselves as the "clinical grade at consumer prices" brand. Their marketing emphasizes the H13 HEPA standard (the same grade used in hospitals and cleanrooms), and all models feature dual-intake airflow designs that pull air from both sides simultaneously. It is an emerging brand worth serious consideration — especially the MA-25, which offers outstanding value in the $200 range.

## Medify Filtration Technology

### H13 True HEPA with Dual Intake

Every Medify purifier uses H13 True HEPA filtration (99.97% capture at 0.3 microns) with a three-stage system: pre-filter mesh, activated carbon layer, and the H13 HEPA media. The filters are combined into a single replaceable cartridge.

The dual-intake design is Medify's signature engineering feature. Rather than pulling air from one side, each unit draws air from both the left and right panels simultaneously. This doubles the effective filter surface area exposed to incoming air, reduces the work each fan has to do, and allows for higher CADR at lower noise levels compared to single-intake designs.

### Ionizer Function

All Medify models include a negative ionizer that can be toggled on or off independently. When activated, it releases negative ions that charge airborne particles, causing them to cluster and settle out of the air faster. Ozone output is CARB-certified at well below the 0.05 ppm safety threshold.

<Callout type="info">
**Medical-Grade Claims:** Medify's use of "medical-grade" refers to the H13 HEPA filter classification, which is indeed the standard used in hospitals and cleanrooms. However, the purifier unit itself is not an FDA-regulated medical device. The filtration media is genuinely H13 grade, which is the same specification used by Dyson, Levoit, and Coway in their current models.

## Model Deep Dives

### MA-112 V2.0: The Industrial-Strength Home Purifier

The MA-112 is Medify's most powerful unit, designed for very large rooms, open-concept homes, and commercial spaces. At 500+ CADR covering 2,500 sq ft, it outperforms virtually every residential purifier on the market including the Coway Airmega 400 (350 CADR) and Alen BreatheSmart 75i (347 CADR).

The dual-filter design uses two large H13 HEPA cartridges, one on each side. The unit is noticeably larger than typical home purifiers (approximately 28 × 16 × 16 inches, 30 lbs) and is designed to sit on the floor in a central location. At $499, it offers extraordinary CADR-per-dollar value for very large spaces.

Noise on the highest setting (66 dB) is loud — similar to a dishwasher. On the lowest setting, 28 dB is reasonable. Auto mode is not available — speed is manually controlled.

### MA-40 V2.0: The All-Around Performer

The MA-40 is Medify's most popular model and strongest overall recommendation. At $349 with 330 CADR and 840 sq ft coverage, it competes directly with the Coway Airmega 400 ($350, 350 CADR) and Alen BreatheSmart 45i ($329, 245 CADR).

The dual-intake design keeps the MA-40 compact despite its high CADR output. Noise ranges from 26 dB (low speed, very quiet) to 56 dB (maximum, moderate). The unit includes a child lock, timer (1/2/4/8 hours), three fan speeds, and the optional ionizer.

### MA-25 V2.0: The Value Champion

The MA-25 at $199 with 250 CADR is Medify's best value play. It covers 500 sq ft in a compact form factor and offers dual-intake H13 HEPA filtration at a price that undercuts the Coway Airmega 250S ($300) while delivering comparable CADR.

This is the model to buy if you want Medify's dual-intake advantage without the MA-40's larger size and higher price. For bedrooms and medium living rooms, the MA-25 is an excellent choice.

### MA-15 and MA-14: Budget Entry Points

The MA-15 ($129, 150 CADR) and MA-14 ($99, 120 CADR) are Medify's compact, single-intake models for bedrooms and small rooms. They use the same H13 HEPA media but in single-filter configurations. Performance is solid for the price, competing with the Levoit Core 300S ($99, 145 CADR) and Core 200S ($79, 118 CADR).

## Real-World Performance Testing

### Example 1: MA-40 in a 700 sq ft Open Living Area

A family in Charlotte, NC placed the MA-40 in their 700 sq ft open living/dining area. With two dogs and a cat, baseline PM2.5 was 18 µg/m³. The dual-intake design pulled air from both sides of the room, and on speed 2 (approximately 40 dB), PM2.5 dropped to 3–5 µg/m³ within 25 minutes.

On maximum speed during cooking, the unit cleared PM2.5 spikes of 80+ µg/m³ back to under 10 µg/m³ in approximately 12 minutes. Pet dander levels (measured indirectly through PM2.5) stayed consistently low during normal operation.

**Monthly electricity cost:** Approximately $3.20 on continuous operation. **Annual filter cost:** $70–$85 (two filter cartridges per year).

### Example 2: MA-25 in a 350 sq ft Bedroom

A user in Phoenix, AZ ran the MA-25 in their master bedroom. On speed 1 (25 dB), it was quiet enough for undisturbed sleep. PM2.5 maintained at 1–3 µg/m³ overnight. The compact dual-intake design fit easily on the floor beside the bed without taking up significant space.

During Arizona dust storms (outdoor PM2.5 100+), the MA-25 on speed 2 kept indoor levels below 8 µg/m³ with windows sealed.

### Example 3: MA-112 in a Yoga Studio

A yoga studio owner in Denver, CO purchased the MA-112 for their 1,800 sq ft studio space. Running continuously on medium speed during classes, the unit maintained PM2.5 at 3–6 µg/m³ throughout the space. Students with allergies and asthma reported noticeable improvement in comfort during practice.

The industrial CADR handled the large volume effectively, and the 500+ CFM output created gentle air circulation throughout the open studio. Noise on medium was approximately 45 dB — acceptable for a yoga environment with background music.

### Example 4: Two MA-14 Units for a Small Apartment

A budget-conscious renter in Boston, MA purchased two MA-14 units ($198 total) for their 600 sq ft apartment. One in the bedroom (200 sq ft) and one in the living room (250 sq ft) provided targeted coverage.

Both rooms maintained PM2.5 at 3–6 µg/m³ consistently. The combined annual filter cost of $60–$80 and electricity cost of approximately $36 made the total operating cost approximately $100/year for two-room coverage — excellent value.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is Medify Air a legitimate brand?",
      answer: "Yes. Medify Air is a US-based company that has been selling air purifiers since 2017. Their products use genuine H13 HEPA filtration, carry AHAM-verified CADR ratings, are CARB-certified for ozone safety, and are widely available on Amazon and their direct website. While not as established as Honeywell or Coway, Medify has built a strong reputation for delivering quality filtration at competitive prices."
    },
    {
      question: "What does medical-grade mean for Medify air purifiers?",
      answer: "Medify's medical-grade claim refers to the H13 HEPA filter classification, which is the standard used in hospitals, surgical suites, and cleanrooms. The H13 designation means the filter captures 99.97% of particles at 0.3 microns. However, the purifier unit itself is not an FDA-regulated medical device. The same H13 HEPA grade is used by Dyson, Levoit, Coway, and most other current brands."
    },
    {
      question: "Medify MA-25 vs Levoit Core 400S: Which is better?",
      answer: "Both are excellent mid-range purifiers. The Levoit Core 400S ($189, 260 CADR) offers slightly more CADR, a smart app (VeSync), and lower filter costs. The Medify MA-25 ($199, 250 CADR) offers dual-intake design for potentially better air circulation and slightly lower noise. Choose Levoit for smart features; choose Medify for dual-intake airflow and slightly better build quality."
    },
    {
      question: "How often do Medify filters need replacing?",
      answer: "Medify recommends filter replacement every 3–4 months for the dual-filter models (MA-40, MA-25, MA-112) and every 4–6 months for the single-filter models (MA-15, MA-14). In practice, filter life varies with air quality and usage. In clean environments with moderate use, many users report extending to 5–6 months on dual-filter models without noticeable performance loss."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Medify have a smartphone app?",
      answer: "No. As of 2026, Medify air purifiers do not have Wi-Fi, app connectivity, or smart home integration. All controls are manual via the unit's control panel. If smart features matter, consider Levoit (VeSync app), Coway (IoCare app), or Winix (Winix Smart app) as alternatives."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the Medify MA-112 good for large homes?",
      answer: "The MA-112 is the most powerful residential air purifier available, with 500+ CADR covering up to 2,500 sq ft. It is excellent for large open-concept homes, basements, commercial spaces, and gyms. The unit is large (28 × 16 × 16 inches, 30 lbs) and loud on high speed (66 dB), so placement and noise should be considered."
    },
    {
      question: "How loud are Medify air purifiers?",
      answer: "Medify units range from 25 dB on low speed (quieter than a whisper) to 48–66 dB on maximum depending on model. The MA-25 at 25–52 dB is the quietest full-size model. The MA-112 at 28–66 dB is the loudest. For bedroom use on low speeds, all Medify models are adequately quiet."
    },
    {
      question: "Are Medify filters expensive?",
      answer: "Medify filter costs are moderate: $30–$45/year for the MA-14 up to $90–$110/year for the MA-112. The dual-filter models (MA-25, MA-40, MA-112) use larger cartridges that cost more per unit but offer proportionally more filtration surface. Overall, Medify's filter costs fall between budget brands (Levoit, Winix) and premium brands (Alen, Dyson)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I turn off the Medify ionizer?",
      answer: "Yes. All Medify models with ionizers have an independent on/off toggle. The ionizer produces negative ions that help particles clump for easier HEPA capture. Ozone output is CARB-certified at safe levels. If you prefer purely mechanical filtration, simply turn the ionizer off — the HEPA filter alone provides excellent particle removal."
    },
    {
      question: "Medify vs Alen: Which brand is better for odors?",
      answer: "Alen BreatheSmart is significantly better for odor removal. Alen offers five interchangeable filter options including a Smoke filter (4 lbs carbon) and Odor filter (2.5 lbs carbon), while Medify's standard activated carbon layer is relatively thin. For primary odor concerns, choose Alen. For overall particle filtration at a lower price, Medify offers better value."
