# MrCool 3rd Gen vs 4th Gen: Which DIY Mini Split to Buy?

The MrCool DIY 4th Gen outperforms the 3rd Gen in every measurable category: 10% higher efficiency (22 vs 20 SEER2 for the 12K model), 9°F colder heating capability (-4°F vs 5°F), 2 dB quieter indoor operation, and improved build quality. The 4th Gen costs $200–$300 more per unit. For most buyers, the 4th Gen is worth the premium — but the 3rd Gen remains a solid value if you find it discounted.

## Energy Cost Savings: 4th Gen vs 3rd Gen

The 10% efficiency improvement translates to real electricity savings over the life of the unit:

| Scenario | 3rd Gen Annual Cost | 4th Gen Annual Cost | Annual Savings | 10-Year Savings |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| 12K, moderate climate, $0.17/kWh | $156 | $142 | $14 | $140 |
| 12K, hot climate, $0.17/kWh | $234 | $213 | $21 | $210 |
| 12K, moderate climate, $0.27/kWh (CA) | $248 | $225 | $23 | $230 |
| 18K, hot climate, $0.17/kWh | $351 | $316 | $35 | $350 |
| 24K, hot climate, $0.17/kWh | $468 | $431 | $37 | $370 |

The energy savings alone don't justify the $200–$300 premium over 10 years. The real value is in the improved cold-climate performance, lower noise, and better build quality.

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Buy the 4th Gen if:** You care about noise (bedrooms, offices), live in a cold climate (the -4°F vs 5°F matters), or plan to keep the unit 10+ years (better build quality = longer life). **Buy the 3rd Gen if:** You find it heavily discounted ($200+ below 4th Gen pricing), you're installing in a garage or workshop where noise isn't critical, or you're in a warm climate where cold-climate heating doesn't matter.
