# Best Mini Split Line Set Cover Kits (DIY Installation Guide)

Line set covers are decorative PVC or metal channels that conceal the refrigerant lines, condensate drain, and communication wire running between your mini split's indoor and outdoor units. The best overall cover kit is the Decorative PVC Line Cover Kit (Rectorseal LD series or equivalent) at $80–$150 for a complete installation — paintable, UV-resistant, and available in straight sections, 90° elbows, couplings, and wall entries to handle any routing.

## Why Install Line Set Covers?

Without covers, your mini split's connection bundle (two copper lines wrapped in black insulation, a drain line, and a wire) runs exposed along your exterior wall. While functional, exposed lines look messy, are vulnerable to UV degradation, and can be damaged by lawn equipment, animals, or weather.

| Factor | Without Covers | With Covers |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Aesthetics | Exposed black insulation | Clean, paintable channel |
| UV protection | Insulation degrades in 3–5 years | Protected indefinitely |
| Physical protection | Vulnerable to impact | Shielded by rigid PVC |
| Pest protection | Rodents can chew insulation | Enclosed and sealed |
| HOA compliance | Often fails HOA standards | Typically approved |
| Cost | $0 | $80–$300 |
