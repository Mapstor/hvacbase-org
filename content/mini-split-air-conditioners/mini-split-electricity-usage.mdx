# How Much Electricity Does a Mini Split Use? (Watts, kWh, Amps)

A 12,000 BTU mini split uses 400–1,200 watts depending on compressor load, consuming 3.2–9.6 kWh per day when running 8 hours. Over a full cooling season, that's 500–900 kWh — roughly $85–$153 at the national average electricity rate of $0.17/kWh. Inverter-driven mini splits average 30–50% less electricity than these maximum wattage figures because they modulate compressor speed rather than running at full power.

The exact electricity consumption depends on five factors: the unit's BTU capacity, its SEER2 efficiency rating, how many hours per day it runs, the temperature differential between your thermostat setting and outdoor temp, and your local electricity rate. Below you'll find real wattage data for every common mini split size, plus worked examples showing actual monthly kWh usage in different climates.

<TableOfContents />

## Mini Split Wattage by Size

Every mini split has a rated wattage that represents maximum power draw at full compressor speed. But inverter mini splits rarely run at maximum — they typically operate at 30–70% capacity once a room reaches the set temperature. The table below shows both rated (maximum) and typical (average) wattage.

### Cooling Mode Wattage

| Unit Size (BTU) | Tonnage | Rated Watts (Max) | Typical Watts (Avg) | Startup Watts |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------:|
| 6,000 | 0.5 ton | 500–600 | 200–350 | 800–1,000 |
| 9,000 | 0.75 ton | 600–900 | 250–500 | 1,000–1,400 |
| 12,000 | 1 ton | 800–1,200 | 350–700 | 1,200–1,800 |
| 15,000 | 1.25 ton | 1,000–1,500 | 500–900 | 1,500–2,200 |
| 18,000 | 1.5 ton | 1,200–1,800 | 600–1,100 | 1,800–2,700 |
| 24,000 | 2 ton | 1,800–2,500 | 900–1,500 | 2,500–3,500 |
| 30,000 | 2.5 ton | 2,200–3,000 | 1,100–1,800 | 3,000–4,200 |
| 36,000 | 3 ton | 2,800–3,800 | 1,400–2,300 | 3,800–5,000 |

### Heating Mode Wattage

Mini splits in heating mode typically consume 10–30% more electricity than in cooling mode for the same BTU output, because the outdoor unit must work harder to extract heat from cold air. At extremely cold temperatures, supplemental electric resistance heating strips may kick in, dramatically increasing wattage.

| Unit Size (BTU) | Heating Watts (Mild, 40°F) | Heating Watts (Cold, 20°F) | Heating Watts (Extreme, 0°F) |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| 9,000 | 300–600 | 600–1,000 | 900–1,500 |
| 12,000 | 400–800 | 800–1,400 | 1,200–2,000 |
| 18,000 | 600–1,200 | 1,200–2,000 | 1,800–3,000 |
| 24,000 | 900–1,600 | 1,600–2,800 | 2,400–4,000 |
| 36,000 | 1,400–2,400 | 2,400–4,000 | 3,600–6,000 |

<Callout type="info">
**Why heating uses more watts in colder weather:** As outdoor temperature drops, the temperature differential between the refrigerant and outdoor air shrinks, making it harder to extract heat. The compressor must work harder (higher speed, higher pressure), drawing more electricity. A mini split heating at 40°F might use 400 watts; the same unit heating at 0°F could use 1,200+ watts — triple the consumption for lower heat output.

## How to Calculate Your Mini Split's kWh Usage

The formula is straightforward:

**Daily kWh = (Average watts × Hours of operation) ÷ 1,000**

**Monthly kWh = Daily kWh × 30**

**Annual kWh = Monthly kWh × Months of use**

### Worked Example 1: 12K BTU in Houston, TX (Hot Climate)

A homeowner runs a 12,000 BTU mini split (SEER2 20) in a Houston bedroom. Summer conditions: outdoor 95°F, indoor setpoint 72°F, unit runs ~14 hours/day.

- SEER2 20 means the unit delivers 20 BTU of cooling per watt-hour
- At full load: 12,000 BTU ÷ 20 SEER2 = 600 watts
- Inverter operating at ~60% average capacity: 600 × 0.6 = **360 watts average**
- Daily kWh: (360 × 14) ÷ 1,000 = **5.04 kWh/day**
- Monthly kWh: 5.04 × 30 = **151.2 kWh/month**
- Cooling season (May–October, 6 months): 151.2 × 6 = **907 kWh/year**
- Annual cooling cost at $0.14/kWh (Texas avg): **$127/year**

### Worked Example 2: 18K BTU in Portland, OR (Mild Climate)

A 500 sq ft living room with an 18,000 BTU mini split (SEER2 22). Portland summer: outdoor 85°F, indoor setpoint 74°F, unit runs ~8 hours/day.

- At full load: 18,000 ÷ 22 = 818 watts
- Inverter at ~40% capacity (small temp differential): 818 × 0.4 = **327 watts average**
- Daily kWh: (327 × 8) ÷ 1,000 = **2.62 kWh/day**
- Monthly kWh: 2.62 × 30 = **78.5 kWh/month**
- Cooling season (June–September, 4 months): 78.5 × 4 = **314 kWh/year**
- Annual cooling cost at $0.12/kWh (Oregon avg): **$37.70/year**

### Worked Example 3: 24K BTU Heating in Minneapolis, MN (Cold Climate)

A 24,000 BTU Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat in a 700 sq ft finished basement. January conditions: outdoor 10°F average, indoor setpoint 68°F, unit runs ~18 hours/day.

- At 10°F, the unit produces ~18,000 BTU of heating (reduced capacity)
- Heating power draw at 10°F: approximately 2,200 watts average
- Daily kWh: (2,200 × 18) ÷ 1,000 = **39.6 kWh/day**
- Monthly kWh: 39.6 × 30 = **1,188 kWh/month**
- Cost at $0.15/kWh (Minnesota avg): **$178/month**
- Full heating season (October–April, 7 months, varying intensity): **~5,500 kWh**
- Annual heating cost: **~$825/year**

### Worked Example 4: Multi-Zone 36K BTU in Atlanta, GA

A 36,000 BTU 3-zone system (12K + 12K + 12K) serving living room, master bedroom, and office. Summer in Atlanta: outdoor 92°F, setpoint 73°F. Not all zones run simultaneously — average 2 zones active for 10 hours/day.

- Two 12K zones at SEER2 18: each draws ~667 watts at full load
- Average load per zone (~55% capacity): 667 × 0.55 = 367 watts
- Two zones running: 367 × 2 = **734 watts average**
- Daily kWh: (734 × 10) ÷ 1,000 = **7.34 kWh/day**
- Monthly kWh: 7.34 × 30 = **220 kWh/month**
- Cooling season (5 months): **1,100 kWh/year cooling**
- Annual cooling cost at $0.14/kWh (Georgia avg): **$154/year**

## Mini Split vs. Other HVAC: Electricity Usage Comparison

How does a mini split stack up against other cooling and heating methods? The differences are dramatic.

### Cooling Comparison (Same 400 sq ft Room)

| System Type | Watts (Avg) | kWh/Day (8 hrs) | kWh/Month | Monthly Cost ($0.17) |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Mini split 12K (SEER2 20) | 350–500 | 2.8–4.0 | 84–120 | $14–$20 |
| Window AC 12K (EER 12) | 1,000 | 8.0 | 240 | $41 |
| Portable AC 12K (EER 8) | 1,500 | 12.0 | 360 | $61 |
| Central AC 12K (SEER2 15) | 550–800 | 4.4–6.4 | 132–192 | $22–$33 |

### Heating Comparison (Same 400 sq ft Room, 40°F Outdoor)

| System Type | Watts (Avg) | kWh/Day (12 hrs) | kWh/Month | Monthly Cost ($0.17) |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Mini split 12K heat pump (HSPF2 10) | 400–700 | 4.8–8.4 | 144–252 | $24–$43 |
| Electric baseboard (1,500W) | 1,500 | 18.0 | 540 | $92 |
| Electric space heater (1,500W) | 1,500 | 18.0 | 540 | $92 |
| Electric furnace (5 kW, cycling) | 2,500 avg | 30.0 | 900 | $153 |

<Callout type="tip">
**The heating comparison is where mini splits truly shine.** A mini split heat pump delivers 2.5–4x more heat per watt than any electric resistance heater (baseboard, space heater, electric furnace). This is because a heat pump moves heat rather than creating it — for every 1 watt of electricity consumed, it delivers 2.5–4 watts of heat energy from outdoor air.

## Factors That Increase Mini Split Electricity Usage

Understanding what drives consumption up helps you optimize performance and keep bills low.

| Factor | Impact on kWh | Why |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Higher temperature differential | +30–100% | Unit works harder to bridge bigger gap |
| Poor insulation | +20–40% | Room gains/loses heat faster |
| Dirty filters | +5–15% | Restricted airflow forces higher compressor load |
| Dirty coils | +10–20% | Reduced heat transfer efficiency |
| Oversized unit | +10–25% | Short cycling wastes energy on startup/shutdown |
| Undersized unit | +15–30% | Unit runs at max capacity continuously |
| Sunny room (unshaded) | +10–20% | Solar heat gain adds to cooling load |
| Multiple occupants | +5–15% | Each person generates ~350 BTU/hr of body heat |
| Heat-generating equipment | +10–30% | Computers, ovens, dryers add to cooling load |
| Low SEER2 rating | +20–50% | Less efficient conversion of electricity to cooling |

## How to Reduce Mini Split Electricity Usage

These practical steps can cut your mini split's electricity consumption by 20–40%:

**Set temperature wisely.** Every degree cooler (or warmer in heating mode) increases energy use by approximately 3–5%. Setting your AC to 76°F instead of 72°F saves roughly 12–20% on cooling costs with minimal comfort impact.

**Clean filters every 2–4 weeks.** A clogged filter is the single biggest efficiency killer. A dirty filter can increase electricity consumption by 5–15% and reduces the unit's cooling capacity, making it run longer to maintain temperature.

**Use the timer and scheduling features.** There's no reason to cool an empty room. Program the unit to power down when you leave and start cooling 15–30 minutes before you return. Most smart mini splits support scheduling through their app.

**Run dry mode in humid conditions.** In humid climates, switching to dry mode uses less electricity than cool mode while still removing moisture. Dry mode runs the compressor at minimum speed and the fan at the lowest setting, using 40–60% less power than cooling mode.

**Shade the outdoor unit.** An outdoor condenser operating in direct sunlight is 5–10% less efficient than one in shade. Plant bushes (keep 2+ feet of clearance) or install an awning. Never enclose the unit — it needs unrestricted airflow.

**Improve room insulation.** Adding weatherstripping, insulating window film, or thermal curtains reduces your room's heat gain/loss, meaning the mini split works less. A $50 investment in window film can save $30–$60 per year in electricity.

## Annual Electricity Cost by State (12,000 BTU Mini Split, SEER2 20)

Electricity rates vary enormously by state. Here's what a 12K mini split costs to run annually in cooling mode across the most expensive and cheapest states:

| State | Avg Rate ($/kWh) | Annual Cooling kWh | Annual Cooling Cost | Annual Heating kWh | Annual Heating Cost |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Hawaii | $0.37 | 650 | $241 | 200 | $74 |
| Connecticut | $0.30 | 550 | $165 | 700 | $210 |
| Massachusetts | $0.28 | 500 | $140 | 800 | $224 |
| California | $0.27 | 600 | $162 | 350 | $95 |
| New York | $0.24 | 550 | $132 | 750 | $180 |
| National Average | $0.17 | 600 | $102 | 600 | $102 |
| Florida | $0.15 | 900 | $135 | 200 | $30 |
| Texas | $0.14 | 850 | $119 | 400 | $56 |
| Georgia | $0.14 | 800 | $112 | 450 | $63 |
| Louisiana | $0.10 | 900 | $90 | 300 | $30 |
| Idaho | $0.10 | 400 | $40 | 700 | $70 |

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** These figures assume moderate usage patterns typical for each climate. Florida and Texas have high cooling kWh because cooling seasons are long (7–9 months). Connecticut and Massachusetts have high heating kWh because heating seasons are long (6–7 months). States like California have moderate usage for both because coastal areas enjoy mild weather year-round.

## Measuring Your Mini Split's Actual Electricity Usage

Want exact data rather than estimates? Here are three ways to measure real consumption:

**Method 1: Kill-A-Watt meter ($25–$35).** Works for 120V mini splits only. Plug the unit into the Kill-A-Watt, and it records cumulative kWh. After 24 hours or a week, you'll have precise consumption data. Limitation: most mini splits are 240V hardwired, so this only works for the few 120V models (typically 6K and 9K units).

**Method 2: CT clamp energy monitor ($40–$80).** Devices like the Emporia Vue or Sense clamp onto the dedicated circuit's wiring in your breaker panel and measure consumption continuously. Works with any voltage, provides real-time data via an app, and tracks usage over weeks and months. This is the best method for most homeowners.

**Method 3: Smart circuit breaker ($80–$150).** Replace your mini split's circuit breaker with a smart breaker (like Eaton or Leviton) that monitors energy consumption and reports to an app. Provides the most accurate data with automatic tracking and historical charts.

**Method 4: Read your utility bill.** If the mini split is the only significant load change in your home, compare utility bills before and after installation. The difference approximates the mini split's consumption. This method is rough but requires no equipment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How many watts does a 12,000 BTU mini split use?",
      answer: "A 12,000 BTU mini split has a rated maximum wattage of 800–1,200 watts depending on the SEER2 rating. However, thanks to inverter technology, the average operating wattage is 350–700 watts. Higher-efficiency units (SEER2 20+) average toward the lower end. The unit only hits maximum wattage during initial cooldown or on extremely hot days when the compressor runs at full speed."
    },
    {
      question: "Does a mini split use a lot of electricity?",
      answer: "No, mini splits are among the most electricity-efficient HVAC systems available. A typical 12,000 BTU mini split uses 3–6 kWh per day during the cooling season, costing $0.50–$1.00 per day at average US electricity rates. That's 50–70% less than a window AC or portable AC of the same capacity, and 30–40% less than central air when accounting for duct losses."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to run a mini split 24/7?",
      answer: "Running a 12,000 BTU mini split (SEER2 20) continuously for a month at $0.17/kWh costs approximately $40–$65. The unit won't actually draw full power for 24 hours straight — once the room reaches the set temperature, the inverter reduces compressor speed to maintenance levels (30–50% capacity). Actual 24/7 cost depends heavily on insulation quality, outdoor temperature, and your thermostat setpoint."
    },
    {
      question: "Do mini splits use more electricity for heating or cooling?",
      answer: "Heating generally uses 10–30% more electricity than cooling for the same BTU output, and the gap widens as outdoor temperatures drop. At 40°F outdoor, heating consumption is similar to cooling. At 20°F, heating uses 30–50% more. At 0°F, heating may use 2–3 times the electricity of cooling. This is because extracting heat from colder air requires the compressor to work progressively harder."
    },
    {
      question: "How does a mini split compare to a space heater on electricity?",
      answer: "A mini split heat pump uses 2.5–4 times less electricity than a space heater to produce the same amount of heat. A 1,500-watt space heater produces exactly 5,118 BTU/hr (100% efficiency). A mini split consuming 500 watts can produce 5,000–7,000 BTU/hr (250–400% effective efficiency) because it moves heat rather than creating it. Over a winter season, the electricity savings can be $300–$700 per room."
    },
    {
      question: "What size breaker does a mini split need?",
      answer: "Most 9,000–12,000 BTU mini splits require a 20-amp, 240V dedicated circuit with a 15 or 20-amp breaker. Larger units (18,000–24,000 BTU) typically need a 30-amp breaker. Units above 24,000 BTU may require a 40-amp breaker. Always check the manufacturer's specifications — the required circuit size is listed on the unit's nameplate and in the installation manual."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I run a mini split on solar panels?",
      answer: "Yes, and it's an excellent combination. A 12,000 BTU mini split averaging 400 watts requires about 1.2–1.6 kW of solar panels to fully offset cooling electricity (accounting for panel efficiency and sun hours). That's 3–4 standard 400-watt panels. With net metering, your solar panels generate credits during peak sun hours that offset the mini split's consumption in the evening. Many homeowners achieve net-zero cooling costs this way."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my mini split use more electricity than expected?",
      answer: "The most common causes of higher-than-expected electricity use are dirty air filters (add 5–15%), poor room insulation or air leaks (add 20–40%), an oversized or undersized unit (add 10–30%), extreme outdoor temperatures that force the compressor to work harder, running at a very low setpoint (every degree costs 3–5% more), dirty condenser coils on the outdoor unit, or low refrigerant charge. Start by cleaning filters and coils, then check for air leaks around windows and doors."
    },
    {
      question: "How much electricity does a multi-zone mini split use?",
      answer: "A multi-zone system's total consumption is the sum of active zones' consumption. A 3-zone 36K system with all zones running uses 2,400–3,800 watts maximum. However, not all zones typically run simultaneously or at full capacity. Real-world average for a 3-zone system with moderate usage is 800–1,500 watts, consuming 6–12 kWh per day. Monthly cost for a 3-zone system averages $35–$65 during the cooling season at national average rates."
    },
    {
      question: "Does leaving a mini split on all day use more electricity than cycling it?",
      answer: "With inverter mini splits, leaving the unit on at a moderate setpoint often uses less electricity than cycling it on and off. When you turn the unit off, the room temperature rises. When you turn it back on, the compressor runs at maximum power to bring the temperature back down — this high-power phase uses significantly more electricity than the low-power maintenance mode of a running inverter. Set it and forget it is the optimal strategy for inverter mini splits."
