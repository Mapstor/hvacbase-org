# How Much Does It Cost to Run a Mini Split? (Monthly Calculator)

A single-zone 12,000 BTU mini split costs $25–$75 per month to run for cooling and $30–$100 per month for heating, depending on your electricity rate, climate, and unit efficiency. At the national average of $0.17/kWh, a 12K unit with SEER2 20 costs approximately $35/month for cooling when running 8 hours daily — about $1.17 per day.

Your actual cost depends on four variables: the unit's BTU size, its efficiency rating (SEER2 for cooling, HSPF2 for heating), daily run hours, and your local electricity price. Use the calculator below to get your specific number, or scroll down for comprehensive cost tables covering every common scenario.

<TableOfContents />

## Monthly Running Cost by Mini Split Size

### Cooling Season Costs (8 Hours/Day Average)

These tables use the national average electricity rate of $0.17/kWh. Adjust proportionally for your local rate.

| Unit Size | SEER2 15 | SEER2 18 | SEER2 20 | SEER2 22 | SEER2 25 | SEER2 30 |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 9,000 BTU | $24/mo | $20/mo | $18/mo | $17/mo | $15/mo | $12/mo |
| 12,000 BTU | $33/mo | $27/mo | $24/mo | $22/mo | $20/mo | $16/mo |
| 15,000 BTU | $41/mo | $34/mo | $31/mo | $28/mo | $24/mo | $20/mo |
| 18,000 BTU | $49/mo | $41/mo | $37/mo | $33/mo | $29/mo | $24/mo |
| 24,000 BTU | $65/mo | $54/mo | $49/mo | $44/mo | $39/mo | $33/mo |

## The Running Cost Formula

Here's the exact math behind every number in this guide:

**Monthly Cooling Cost = (BTU ÷ SEER2 × Hours/Day × 30) ÷ 1,000 × $/kWh**

**Monthly Heating Cost = (BTU ÷ HSPF2 × Hours/Day × 30) ÷ 1,000 × $/kWh**

Where BTU is your unit's capacity, SEER2/HSPF2 is the efficiency rating, Hours/Day is your average daily run time, and $/kWh is your electricity rate.

### Worked Example 1: Single Bedroom Mini Split in Phoenix

**Setup:** 9,000 BTU MrCool DIY 4th Gen (SEER2 22), Phoenix, AZ electricity at $0.13/kWh, running 12 hours/day during summer.

## Running Cost Comparison: Mini Split vs. Alternatives

The real value of mini split running costs becomes clear when you compare to alternatives that serve the same purpose.

### Annual Running Cost Comparison (Same 400 sq ft Room)

| System | Annual Cooling Cost | Annual Heating Cost | Total Annual | Savings vs. Mini Split |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Mini split 12K (SEER2 20) | $144 | $186 | $330 | — |
| Window AC + baseboard heat | $288 | $648 | $936 | Mini split saves $606 |
| Portable AC + space heaters | $360 | $648 | $1,008 | Mini split saves $678 |
| Central AC + gas furnace | $216 | $240 | $456 | Mini split saves $126 |
| Central AC + electric furnace | $216 | $540 | $756 | Mini split saves $426 |

**Assumptions:** National average electricity at $0.17/kWh, natural gas at $1.50/therm, moderate climate (5 months cooling, 5 months heating), 8 hours/day cooling, 10 hours/day heating.

### Cost Payback Period

The running cost savings from a mini split help offset the installation cost:

| Scenario | Installation Cost | Annual Savings | Payback Period |
|----------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Replace window ACs + baseboard | $2,500 (DIY MrCool) | $606/year | 4.1 years |
| Replace window ACs + baseboard | $4,000 (pro Fujitsu) | $606/year | 6.6 years |
| Replace portable AC + space heaters | $2,500 (DIY MrCool) | $678/year | 3.7 years |
| Supplement central air (hot room) | $2,500 (DIY MrCool) | $200/year | 12.5 years |
| Replace electric furnace (heating) | $4,000 (pro Daikin) | $426/year | 9.4 years |

<Callout type="tip">
**Best ROI scenario:** If you're replacing window ACs plus electric baseboard heat (or space heaters), a mini split pays for itself in 3.7–6.6 years through electricity savings alone. After that, you're saving $500–$700 per year for the remaining 10–15 years of the unit's life — that's $5,000–$10,500 in lifetime savings.

## How to Lower Your Monthly Mini Split Cost

These strategies can reduce your monthly running cost by 20–40%:

**Raise cooling setpoint by 2–4°F.** Moving from 72°F to 76°F saves approximately 8–16% on cooling costs. At $35/month, that's $3–$6/month savings. Most people acclimate within a week and don't notice the difference.

**Use eco mode or sleep mode at night.** These modes raise the setpoint by 1–2°F and reduce fan speed. Since your body naturally cools during sleep, you'll sleep just as comfortably while using 15–25% less electricity overnight.

**Schedule run times.** Don't cool an empty room. If you're at work from 9 AM to 5 PM, schedule the unit to power down at 9 and start pre-cooling at 4:30 PM. That eliminates 8 hours of daytime running — potentially halving your monthly cost.

**Clean filters religiously.** Dirty filters increase electricity consumption by 5–15%. If you pay $35/month, dirty filters add $1.75–$5.25/month — up to $63/year in wasted electricity for a maintenance task that takes 5 minutes.

**Improve room insulation.** Adding thermal curtains ($30–$80), weatherstripping ($10–$20), or window film ($50–$100) can reduce your cooling/heating load by 15–25%. The one-time investment of $90–$200 saves $40–$100 per year permanently.

**Use ceiling fans.** Running a ceiling fan (50 watts) creates a wind-chill effect that lets you raise the AC setpoint by 3–4°F without sacrificing comfort. The fan costs $0.20/day to run but saves $0.50–$1.00/day in AC costs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How much does a mini split cost per month?",
      answer: "A single-zone 12,000 BTU mini split costs $25–$75 per month for cooling and $30–$100 per month for heating at typical US electricity rates. The wide range reflects differences in electricity rates ($0.10–$0.37/kWh across states), climate severity, daily run hours, and unit efficiency. A high-efficiency unit (SEER2 22+) in a mild climate with average electricity rates costs closer to $25–$35/month."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to run a mini split per day?",
      answer: "A 12,000 BTU mini split costs $0.80–$2.50 per day for cooling (running 8 hours) at national average electricity rates. In low-rate states like Louisiana or Washington, the daily cost drops to $0.50–$1.50. In high-rate states like Connecticut or Hawaii, it rises to $1.50–$4.00. Daily heating costs are slightly higher, typically $1.00–$3.50 for a 12K unit."
    },
    {
      question: "Is a mini split cheaper to run than central air?",
      answer: "Yes, in most scenarios. A mini split running at SEER2 20 costs approximately 20–30% less per BTU of cooling than central air at SEER2 15, primarily because mini splits eliminate the 20–30% energy loss from ductwork. However, if you're cooling 5+ rooms, a central system may be cheaper than running 5+ individual mini split zones, because multi-zone mini splits lose some efficiency when all zones are active simultaneously."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it cheaper to leave a mini split running all day?",
      answer: "With an inverter mini split, yes — it's often cheaper to leave it running at a moderate setpoint than to cycle it on and off. Inverter compressors run at low power (30–40% capacity) to maintain temperature, using less total electricity than the high-power burst needed to cool down a hot room after the AC was off for hours. Set it to a comfortable temperature and let the inverter manage the load."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to heat with a mini split vs. gas furnace?",
      answer: "At national average energy prices ($0.17/kWh electricity, $1.50/therm natural gas), a mini split heat pump costs roughly the same as a 95% efficient gas furnace for the same heating output. The mini split wins in regions with cheap electricity (Pacific Northwest, parts of the South) and loses in regions with expensive electricity and cheap gas (parts of the Midwest). When natural gas prices spike, mini splits become significantly cheaper."
    },
    {
      question: "Does a mini split cost more to run in humid climates?",
      answer: "Slightly, yes. In humid climates (Southeast US, Gulf Coast), the mini split must remove more moisture from the air during cooling, which requires the compressor to work harder and longer. The additional cost is typically 10–20% compared to the same unit in a dry climate. Using dry mode when full cooling isn't needed can help manage humidity-related costs."
    },
    {
      question: "How much electricity does a mini split use on standby?",
      answer: "A mini split in standby mode (powered on but not actively cooling or heating) draws 5–30 watts depending on the brand and model. This standby consumption costs approximately $0.02–$0.15 per day, or $0.60–$4.50 per month. While minimal, you can eliminate standby draw entirely by switching the unit off at the breaker during extended absences — just allow 30 minutes for the system to stabilize when you power it back on."
    },
    {
      question: "What's more expensive to run — a mini split or a window AC?",
      answer: "A window AC costs 50–100% more to run than a mini split of the same BTU capacity. A 12,000 BTU window AC with an EER of 12 draws about 1,000 watts. A 12,000 BTU mini split at SEER2 20 averages 350–500 watts. Over a 5-month cooling season at $0.17/kWh, the window AC costs roughly $200 and the mini split costs roughly $100–$140. The mini split saves $60–$100 per cooling season, per room."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does a 5-zone mini split cost to run per month?",
      answer: "A 5-zone mini split system costs $80–$250 per month during peak cooling or heating season, depending on how many zones are active and your electricity rate. With average usage (3 zones active, moderate climate, $0.17/kWh), expect $100–$150 per month. During shoulder seasons when only 1–2 zones run, monthly costs drop to $30–$60. Annual total for whole-home mini split HVAC typically ranges from $800–$1,500."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the SEER2 rating really affect my monthly bill?",
      answer: "Absolutely. For a 12,000 BTU unit running 8 hours/day at $0.17/kWh, the monthly cooling cost is $33 at SEER2 15 versus $16 at SEER2 30 — nearly half the cost. Over a 5-month cooling season, that's $85 in annual savings from the higher rating. Over the 15-year life of the unit, the SEER2 30 saves $1,275 in cooling costs alone. Higher SEER2 units cost more upfront, but the savings compound significantly over time."
