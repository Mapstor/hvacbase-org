# Mini Split Air Conditioners: Complete Guide (2026)

Mini split air conditioners deliver targeted heating and cooling to individual rooms without ductwork, operating at 25–40% higher efficiency than conventional central HVAC systems. A single-zone mini split costs $1,500–$4,500 installed, runs on 500–1,500 watts, and can cut your energy bills by $500–$1,200 per year compared to window units or baseboard heaters.

Whether you're adding AC to a room that lacks ductwork, building a new addition, or considering a whole-home solution that gives each room its own thermostat, this guide covers everything: how mini splits work, what they cost, which brands lead the market in 2026, how to size your system, and when a mini split makes more sense than central air.

<TableOfContents />

## What Is a Mini Split Air Conditioner?

A mini split is a two-piece HVAC system consisting of an outdoor compressor/condenser unit connected to one or more indoor air-handling units via refrigerant lines, a condensate drain, and communication wiring. The name "mini split" comes from the split-system design — the same architecture used by central AC systems — shrunk down for room-level or zone-level use.

The key difference from central air is the absence of ductwork. Each indoor unit mounts directly in the room it serves, delivering conditioned air right where you need it. This eliminates the 20–30% energy loss that the DOE attributes to leaky, poorly insulated duct systems in the average American home.

Most modern mini splits are heat pumps, meaning they both cool and heat. In cooling mode, they absorb heat from indoor air and pump it outside. In heating mode, they reverse the refrigerant cycle and extract heat from outdoor air — even at temperatures well below freezing. Cold-climate models from Mitsubishi, Fujitsu, and Daikin maintain rated heating capacity down to -13°F to -22°F.

### Core Components

| Component | Location | Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Compressor | Outdoor unit | Pressurizes refrigerant to drive the heat exchange cycle |
| Condenser coil | Outdoor unit | Releases absorbed heat to outdoor air (cooling mode) |
| Evaporator coil | Indoor unit | Absorbs heat from indoor air (cooling mode) |
| Expansion valve | Indoor unit | Reduces refrigerant pressure before evaporator |
| Inverter drive | Outdoor unit | Modulates compressor speed for variable-output operation |
| Line set | Between units | Copper tubing carrying refrigerant (liquid + suction lines) |
| Condensate drain | Indoor unit | Removes moisture collected during cooling |
| Communication wire | Between units | Transmits control signals between indoor and outdoor units |

### Single-Zone vs. Multi-Zone Systems

A single-zone system pairs one outdoor unit with one indoor unit. It's the simplest, most efficient, and most affordable configuration — ideal for adding climate control to a single room, garage, or addition.

A multi-zone system connects one outdoor unit to 2–5 (sometimes up to 8) indoor units. Each zone gets independent temperature control. Multi-zone systems cost less per zone than installing separate single-zone units, but they introduce complexity: the outdoor compressor must be sized for the combined load, and oversizing individual zones can reduce dehumidification performance.

<Callout type="tip">
**Rule of thumb:** If you're conditioning 1–2 rooms, single-zone systems deliver the best efficiency and value. For 3+ rooms, a multi-zone system usually makes more financial sense — but only if the zones have similar usage patterns.
</Callout>

## How Mini Splits Work: The Refrigeration Cycle

Understanding the basic operating cycle helps you make smarter purchasing and maintenance decisions. Here's the 7-step process in cooling mode:

1. **Warm indoor air** passes over the evaporator coil inside the indoor unit.
2. **Liquid refrigerant** in the evaporator absorbs that heat and vaporizes into a low-pressure gas.
3. The **suction line** carries the refrigerant gas to the outdoor compressor.
4. The **inverter-driven compressor** pressurizes the gas, dramatically increasing its temperature.
5. The **hot, high-pressure gas** flows through the outdoor condenser coil, where a fan pushes outdoor air across the coil, dissipating heat.
6. The refrigerant **condenses back into a liquid** as it releases heat outdoors.
7. The **liquid line** carries the cooled refrigerant back indoors through an expansion valve, which drops the pressure and temperature before it re-enters the evaporator. The cycle repeats.

In heating mode, a reversing valve switches the refrigerant flow direction. The outdoor coil becomes the evaporator (absorbing heat from outside air), and the indoor coil becomes the condenser (releasing heat into your room).

### Inverter Technology: Why It Matters

Older AC systems and budget mini splits use fixed-speed compressors — they're either running at 100% capacity or off. This constant cycling wastes energy and creates temperature swings of 3–5°F.

Inverter-driven mini splits modulate compressor speed continuously, ramping up to meet demand and throttling down as the room approaches set temperature. The benefits are substantial:

| Feature | Fixed-Speed | Inverter-Driven |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Compressor operation | On/off cycling | Continuous modulation (10–100%) |
| Temperature accuracy | ±3–5°F | ±0.5–1°F |
| Energy consumption | Higher (startup surges) | 30–50% lower |
| Noise level | Louder (full-speed cycling) | Quieter at partial load |
| Component lifespan | Shorter (cycling stress) | Longer (smooth operation) |
| Dehumidification | Inconsistent | Superior at partial load |

<Callout type="important">
Every reputable mini split brand now uses inverter technology. If a unit doesn't have an inverter compressor, it's either a very old design or a budget unit you should avoid. Check for "DC inverter" in the specs.

## Mini Split Sizing: How to Choose the Right BTU Capacity

The single biggest mistake homeowners make is choosing the wrong size. An undersized unit can't keep up on hot days. An oversized unit short-cycles, wastes energy, and dehumidifies poorly — leaving you with a cold, clammy room.

### Quick Sizing by Room Area

| Room Size (sq ft) | Recommended BTUs | Typical Model Size |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 150–250 | 6,000–9,000 | 9K (0.75-ton) |
| 250–400 | 9,000–12,000 | 12K (1-ton) |
| 400–550 | 12,000–15,000 | 15K (1.25-ton) |
| 550–700 | 15,000–18,000 | 18K (1.5-ton) |
| 700–1,000 | 18,000–24,000 | 24K (2-ton) |
| 1,000–1,300 | 24,000–30,000 | 30K (2.5-ton) |
| 1,300–1,500 | 30,000–36,000 | 36K (3-ton) |

### Adjustment Factors

The table above assumes standard conditions: 8-foot ceilings, moderate climate, average insulation, 2 occupants, and moderate sun exposure. Adjust your BTU requirement based on these real-world factors:

| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Sunny room (south/west facing) | +10–15% |
| Shaded room (north facing, covered) | -10% |
| High ceilings (9–10 ft) | +12–25% |
| Vaulted/cathedral ceilings | +20–30% |
| Poor insulation / old windows | +20–30% |
| Kitchen or room with heat-generating equipment | +4,000 BTU |
| Each additional occupant beyond 2 | +600 BTU |
| Climate zone 1–2 (hot/humid, e.g., Miami, Houston) | +10–20% |
| Climate zone 6–7 (cold, e.g., Minneapolis, Anchorage) | Size for heating load, not cooling |

### Worked Example 1: Master Bedroom

You have a 350 sq ft master bedroom in Phoenix, AZ. The room faces west (lots of afternoon sun), has 9-foot ceilings, average insulation, and 2 occupants.

- Base BTU: 350 sq ft × ~30 BTU/sq ft = 10,500 BTU
- West-facing sun adjustment: +15% → +1,575 BTU
- 9-foot ceiling adjustment: +12% → +1,260 BTU
- Adjusted total: 13,335 BTU
- **Recommended unit: 15,000 BTU (15K)**

### Worked Example 2: Open-Plan Living Area

You have a 900 sq ft open living/dining area in Atlanta, GA. Standard 8-foot ceilings, moderate insulation, 3 regular occupants, south-facing windows.

- Base BTU: 900 sq ft × ~30 BTU/sq ft = 27,000 BTU
- South-facing sun: +10% → +2,700 BTU
- Extra occupant: +600 BTU

- **Recommended unit: 30,000 BTU (30K) or 36,000 BTU (36K)**

### Worked Example 3: Garage Workshop

You have a 500 sq ft detached 2-car garage in Denver, CO. Uninsulated walls, single-pane windows, 10-foot ceilings, significant heat from power tools.

- Base BTU: 500 sq ft × ~30 BTU/sq ft = 15,000 BTU
- Poor insulation: +30% → +4,500 BTU
- High ceilings: +25% → +3,750 BTU
- Heat-generating equipment: +4,000 BTU
- Adjusted total: 27,250 BTU
- **Recommended unit: 30,000 BTU (30K)**

### Worked Example 4: Sunroom Addition

You have a 200 sq ft sunroom in Charlotte, NC. Floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides, cathedral ceiling (14 ft at peak), well-insulated floor, south-east facing.

- Base BTU: 200 sq ft × ~30 BTU/sq ft = 6,000 BTU
- Extreme sun exposure (3 glass walls): +25% → +1,500 BTU
- Cathedral ceiling: +30% → +1,800 BTU
- Hot/humid climate zone: +15% → +900 BTU
- Adjusted total: 10,200 BTU

## Top Mini Split Brands Compared (2026)

The mini split market splits into three tiers: premium Japanese brands (Mitsubishi, Daikin, Fujitsu), mid-tier brands (LG, Samsung, Carrier, Bosch), and budget/DIY brands (MrCool, Senville, Pioneer, Cooper&Hunter).

### Brand Comparison Table

| Brand | Origin | SEER2 Range | Cold-Climate Heating | Warranty (Compressor) | DIY Install? | Price Level |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Mitsubishi | Japan | 17–40.1 | Down to -13°F (Hyper-Heat) | 7–12 years | No (pro only) | $$$ |
| Daikin | Japan | 17–38.6 | Down to -13°F (Aurora) | 12 years | No (pro only) | $$$ |
| Fujitsu | Japan | 18–33 | Down to -15°F (RLS3H) | 10 years | No (pro only) | $$ – $$$ |

| Cooper&Hunter | USA (mfg China) | 17–23 | Down to -22°F (Sophia) | 7 years | Semi-DIY | $ |

### Which Brand Should You Choose?

**Best overall quality and efficiency:** Mitsubishi Electric. Their Hyper-Heat (H2i) technology is the gold standard for cold-climate performance, and their MSZ-FH series achieves a staggering 33.1 SEER2. Mitsubishi units are the quietest on the market (as low as 19 dB indoor) and have the longest track record of reliability. The downside: they cost 40–60% more than mid-tier options and require professional installation through their Diamond Contractor network.

**Best for DIY installation:** MrCool DIY series. Pre-charged line sets with quick-connect fittings mean no HVAC tools, no vacuum pump, and no EPA 608 certification required. The 4th Gen models improved efficiency to 22 SEER2 and added cold-climate heating to -4°F. Trade-off: they don't match premium brands on efficiency, noise, or longevity.

**Best value for professional install:** Fujitsu Halcyon. You get Japanese engineering and reliability at 15–25% less than Mitsubishi. The RLS3H series handles cold climates well, and units are widely available through HVAC distributors. Fujitsu's 10-year compressor warranty is competitive.

**Best budget option:** Senville SENL series. Surprisingly capable units at very low prices ($600–$1,000 for a single zone). Some models claim operation down to -22°F. The catch: thinner copper, louder operation, and less responsive tech support. Best for garages, workshops, or spaces where premium performance isn't critical.

## Mini Split Types: Indoor Unit Styles

Mini splits aren't limited to the familiar wall-mounted unit. Several indoor unit styles exist, each suited to different spaces and aesthetic preferences.

| Indoor Unit Style | Best For | Mounting | Visibility | Typical Cost Premium |
|-------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| Wall-mounted | Most rooms | High on wall | Moderate | Base price |
| Ceiling cassette | Commercial, open plans | Recessed in ceiling | Low (grille only) | +30–50% |
| Floor-mounted | Rooms with low walls, elderly | Floor level | Moderate | +10–20% |
| Slim duct (concealed) | Rooms with drop ceilings, whole-home | Hidden above ceiling | Minimal (grille only) | +20–40% |
| Ceiling suspended | Commercial, large rooms | Hangs from ceiling | High | +20–30% |

**Wall-mounted units** account for 80%+ of residential mini split installations. They mount 7–8 feet high on the wall, distribute air effectively, and cost the least. Unless you have a specific reason to choose another style, wall-mount is the default.

**Ceiling cassettes** are the most aesthetically appealing option — only the flush-mount grille is visible. They distribute air in 4 directions and excel in open floor plans. However, they require ceiling space for the unit body (about 8–10 inches), professional installation is more complex, and they cost significantly more.

**Slim duct (concealed) units** hide completely inside a ceiling cavity or soffit, with only supply and return air grilles visible. This is the closest a mini split gets to looking like central air. Slim duct units are popular for whole-home mini split installations where aesthetics matter.

## Mini Split vs. Central Air: When Each Wins

This is the most common question homeowners ask. The answer depends on your specific situation.

### Mini Split Wins When:

You're adding AC to a home without existing ductwork — this avoids $5,000–$15,000 in duct installation costs. Mini splits also win when you're conditioning 1–3 specific rooms rather than the whole house, when you want zone-by-zone temperature control with different temps in different rooms, when you're building an addition or finishing a basement or converting a garage, when you want to eliminate duct losses that waste 20–30% of energy, when you need both heating and cooling from one system, or when you need a solution for a room that's always too hot or too cold.

### Central Air Wins When:

Your home already has ductwork in good condition and you're simply replacing a system. Central air also wins when you're conditioning 5+ rooms with similar usage patterns, when you prefer zero visible indoor equipment since all components are hidden in the ductwork, when your home's layout makes running multiple line sets impractical, or when initial installed cost matters more than long-term operating cost.

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Bottom line:** If your home already has good ductwork and you're replacing a central system, sticking with central air usually makes sense. If you're starting fresh, adding AC to specific rooms, or prioritizing efficiency and zone control, mini splits are the better investment.
</Callout>

## Efficiency Ratings Explained: SEER2, HSPF2, and EER2

Mini split efficiency is measured by three key ratings, all updated to the newer SEER2/HSPF2 standards in January 2023:

| Rating | Measures | Higher Is | Good | Better | Best |
|--------|----------|-----------|------|--------|------|
| SEER2 | Seasonal cooling efficiency | Better | 15–18 | 19–24 | 25+ |
| EER2 | Cooling efficiency at peak (95°F) | Better | 10–12 | 12–14 | 14+ |
| HSPF2 | Seasonal heating efficiency | Better | 8–9 | 9.5–11 | 11+ |
| COP (heating) | Heat output ÷ energy input | Better | 2.5–3.0 | 3.0–4.0 | 4.0+ |

**SEER2** (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) is the primary cooling metric. It divides total cooling output (BTU) by total energy input (watt-hours) over a typical cooling season. A SEER2 20 unit uses about 25% less electricity than a SEER2 15 unit for the same cooling.

**HSPF2** (Heating Seasonal Performance Factor) measures heating efficiency similarly. A mini split with an HSPF2 of 10 delivers 10 BTU of heat for every watt-hour of electricity consumed — roughly 3x more efficient than electric resistance heating.

**EER2** measures efficiency at a specific outdoor temperature (95°F), giving you a snapshot of peak-load performance. This matters most in hot climates where your unit runs hard on the hottest days.

### Efficiency Savings: Worked Example

Comparing a 12,000 BTU mini split at different SEER2 ratings, running 1,500 cooling hours/year at $0.17/kWh:

| SEER2 Rating | Annual kWh (Cooling) | Annual Cost | Savings vs. SEER2 15 |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 15 | 800 | $136 | — |
| 18 | 667 | $113 | $23/year |
| 22 | 545 | $93 | $43/year |
| 28 | 429 | $73 | $63/year |
| 33 | 364 | $62 | $74/year |

The savings look modest for a single zone, but they compound quickly with multi-zone systems and in high-rate electricity markets. In Hawaii ($0.37/kWh), the SEER2 33 unit saves $165/year over the SEER2 15 unit — for a single zone.

## Installation: DIY vs. Professional

### Professional Installation

Most mini splits require professional installation by a licensed HVAC technician. The process involves handling refrigerant (requires EPA 608 certification), electrical work (may require a licensed electrician), and proper system commissioning (vacuum, charge verification, airflow testing).

**Typical professional installation timeline:** 4–8 hours for a single zone, 1–2 days for multi-zone systems.

**What to look for in an installer:**
- NATE (North American Technician Excellence) certification
- EPA 608 Universal certification
- Brand-specific training (Mitsubishi Diamond, Daikin Comfort Pro, etc.)
- License and insurance appropriate for your state
- Willingness to perform Manual J load calculation
- At least 3 references from mini split installations

### DIY Installation

Brands like MrCool, Senville, and Pioneer sell DIY-friendly units with pre-charged, quick-connect line sets that eliminate the need for specialized refrigerant tools. A handy homeowner can complete a single-zone DIY installation in 4–8 hours.

**DIY installation requires:** basic hand tools (drill, hole saw, level, wrenches), ability to mount a 20–30 lb indoor unit at 7–8 feet, ability to mount a 70–120 lb outdoor unit on a pad or bracket, comfort drilling a 3-inch hole through an exterior wall, and a dedicated electrical circuit which may require an electrician depending on your jurisdiction.

**DIY installation saves:** $1,000–$3,000 in labor costs per zone.

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Even with DIY units, the electrical connection often requires a licensed electrician and a permit. Running a 240V, 20–30A dedicated circuit is not a typical DIY task. Budget $200–$500 for an electrician, and check your local permit requirements.
</Callout>

## Maintenance: Keeping Your Mini Split Running Efficiently

Mini splits require less maintenance than central air systems (no ductwork to clean), but they're not maintenance-free. Neglected mini splits lose 5–15% efficiency per year and can develop mold in the indoor unit.

### Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | DIY? | Importance |
|------|-----------|------|------------|
| Clean/replace air filters | Every 2–4 weeks | Yes | Critical |
| Clean indoor unit coils | Every 3–6 months | Yes (with care) | High |
| Clean outdoor unit coils | Every 6–12 months | Yes | High |
| Clear condensate drain | Every 3–6 months | Yes | High |
| Check refrigerant lines for damage | Annually | Yes (visual) | Medium |
| Professional deep cleaning | Every 1–2 years | No | High |
| Check refrigerant charge | Every 2–3 years | No | Medium |

**Filter cleaning** is the single most important maintenance task. Clogged filters restrict airflow, force the compressor to work harder, increase energy consumption by 5–15%, and can cause the evaporator coil to ice up. Most mini split filters are washable — rinse them under running water, let them dry completely, and reinstall.

**Coil cleaning** prevents the buildup of dust, pet hair, and mold that degrades heat transfer. For the indoor unit, use a no-rinse coil cleaner spray. For the outdoor unit, use a garden hose to gently wash the fins (never use a pressure washer — it bends the delicate aluminum fins).

## Common Mini Split Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Unit runs but doesn't cool | Dirty filters/coils, low refrigerant | Clean filters, clean coils, call for refrigerant check |
| Ice forming on indoor unit | Restricted airflow, low refrigerant, dirty coil | Clean filters, clean coil, check refrigerant |
| Water leaking from indoor unit | Clogged condensate drain | Clear drain line with wet/dry vac or compressed air |
| Unit won't turn on | Tripped breaker, dead remote batteries, error code | Reset breaker, replace batteries, check error code |
| Musty smell from indoor unit | Mold/mildew on coil or blower wheel | Deep clean with coil cleaner, run dry mode after cooling |
| Outdoor unit making loud noise | Debris in fan, loose mounting, failing compressor | Clear debris, tighten bolts, call professional |
| Short cycling (on/off rapidly) | Oversized unit, refrigerant issue, sensor problem | Verify sizing, check refrigerant, inspect thermistor |
| Uneven heating/cooling | Wrong unit size, poor placement, obstructed airflow | Resize, reposition, clear obstructions |

## Tax Credits and Rebates (2026)

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides significant incentives for heat pump installations, including mini splits:

**Federal tax credit (25C):** Up to $2,000 per year for qualifying heat pump installations. The mini split must meet the CEE Tier 1 or higher efficiency requirements (SEER2 16+, EER2 12+, HSPF2 9+). Most name-brand mini splits qualify.

**IRA HEEHR rebates:** Income-qualified homeowners may receive up to $8,000 in point-of-sale rebates for heat pump installations. These rebates are income-tiered and administered by individual states — availability and amounts vary by state and many states have begun distributing these funds in 2026–2026.

**State and utility rebates:** Many states and utilities offer additional rebates of $200–$2,000 for qualifying mini split heat pump installations. Check the DSIRE database (dsireusa.org) for incentives in your area.

<Callout type="tip">
**Don't leave money on the table.** Between federal tax credits ($2,000), IRA rebates (up to $8,000), and state/utility incentives, some homeowners can offset 30–60% of their mini split installation cost. Ask your installer about qualifying equipment and applicable incentives before signing a contract.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How long do mini split air conditioners last?",
      answer: "A well-maintained mini split lasts 15–20 years on average. Premium brands like Mitsubishi and Daikin often exceed 20 years. The compressor is the most critical component — inverter compressors experience less mechanical stress than fixed-speed units, which contributes to their longer lifespan. Regular filter cleaning and annual professional maintenance are the keys to maximizing longevity."
    },
    {
      question: "Can a mini split heat and cool?",
      answer: "Yes, the vast majority of mini splits sold today are heat pumps that provide both heating and cooling. In cooling mode, they remove heat from indoor air and release it outside. In heating mode, they reverse the cycle and extract heat from outdoor air. Modern cold-climate models maintain effective heating performance at outdoor temperatures as low as -13°F to -22°F."
    },
    {
      question: "Are mini splits noisy?",
      answer: "Mini splits are among the quietest HVAC systems available. Indoor units typically operate at 19–40 dB — quieter than a library (40 dB) at their lowest settings. Outdoor units run at 46–58 dB, comparable to a normal conversation. Premium brands like Mitsubishi are the quietest, with some models hitting 19 dB on low fan speed. Budget models tend to be 5–10 dB louder."
    },
    {
      question: "Do mini splits dehumidify?",
      answer: "Yes, mini splits dehumidify during cooling operation — moisture condenses on the cold evaporator coil and drains away. A properly sized mini split removes 1–3 pints of moisture per hour. Many units also include a dedicated 'dry mode' that prioritizes dehumidification over cooling, running the compressor at low speed and the fan at minimum to maximize moisture removal without overcooling the room."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I install a mini split myself?",
      answer: "Yes, if you choose a DIY-designed unit like MrCool DIY or Senville. These come with pre-charged, quick-connect line sets that don't require refrigerant handling tools or EPA certification. A handy homeowner can complete a single-zone installation in 4–8 hours. However, the electrical connection (240V dedicated circuit) typically requires a licensed electrician and a permit in most jurisdictions."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to run a mini split per month?",
      answer: "A single-zone 12,000 BTU mini split costs $25–$75 per month during the cooling season, depending on your climate and electricity rate. Heating costs are similar or slightly higher. A whole-home multi-zone system (4–5 zones) runs $120–$250 per month during peak season. Mini splits cost 30–50% less to operate than window units, portable ACs, or electric baseboard heaters for the same space."
    },
    {
      question: "Do mini splits work in cold weather?",
      answer: "Standard mini splits work well down to about 15–20°F but lose significant heating capacity below that. Cold-climate (hyper-heat) models from Mitsubishi, Daikin, Fujitsu, and Carrier maintain rated heating capacity down to -13°F to -22°F using enhanced compressor technology and larger heat exchangers. If you live in IECC climate zones 5–7 (northern states, Canada), choose a cold-climate rated model."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between SEER and SEER2?",
      answer: "SEER2 replaced SEER as the standard efficiency rating in January 2023. SEER2 uses more realistic testing conditions (higher external static pressure) that better represent real-world performance. SEER2 numbers are roughly 5–10% lower than old SEER numbers for the same unit. For example, a unit rated SEER 20 under the old standard might rate SEER2 18 under the new standard. When comparing units, make sure you're comparing the same rating type."
    },
    {
      question: "How many rooms can one mini split cool?",
      answer: "A single-zone mini split cools one room or open area. Multi-zone systems connect one outdoor unit to 2–8 indoor units, each in a separate room. For example, a 5-zone system can independently control the temperature in 5 different rooms. The outdoor unit must be sized for the combined load of all zones. Most residential multi-zone systems top out at 5 zones; larger configurations (6–8 zones) typically use commercial-grade outdoor units."
    },
    {
      question: "Do mini splits increase home value?",
      answer: "Yes, energy-efficient HVAC systems including mini splits can increase home value. A National Association of Realtors study found that HVAC upgrades recover 71–85% of their cost at resale. Mini splits are particularly valuable in homes without existing central air, where they represent a significant comfort and functionality upgrade. In hot-climate markets like Florida, Arizona, and Texas, adding AC to a non-air-conditioned space can increase home value by 5–10%."
