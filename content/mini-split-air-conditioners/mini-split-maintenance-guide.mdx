# Mini Split Maintenance: Cleaning, Filters, and Annual Service Guide

A well-maintained mini split lasts 15–20 years and operates at peak efficiency throughout its life. A neglected one loses 5–15% efficiency per year, develops mold that creates musty odors, and may fail in 8–12 years. The good news: 90% of mini split maintenance is simple, takes less than 30 minutes, and costs nothing beyond your time.

| Refrigerant charge check | Every 2–3 years | 30 min | No | Manifold gauges | Medium |

## Step-by-Step Filter Cleaning

This is the single most important maintenance task. Dirty filters increase electricity use by 5–15%, reduce cooling/heating capacity, strain the compressor, and create conditions for mold growth.

**Step 1:** Turn off the unit using the remote or the power switch.

**Step 2:** Lift the front panel of the indoor unit. Most panels swing up and lock in an open position.

**Step 3:** Slide the air filters out from their tracks. Most units have 2 removable filters.

**Step 4:** Rinse filters under lukewarm running water. For stubborn buildup, soak in warm water with mild dish soap for 10 minutes, then rinse.

**Step 5:** Shake off excess water and stand filters upright to air dry completely. This takes 2–4 hours. Never reinstall wet filters — moisture promotes mold growth.

**Step 6:** Slide dry filters back into their tracks.

**Step 7:** Close the front panel and resume normal operation.

## Evaporator Coil Cleaning

The evaporator coil is the array of thin aluminum fins behind the filters in the indoor unit. Over time, dust, pet hair, and mold accumulate on the coil, reducing heat transfer efficiency.

**When to clean:** Every 3–6 months, or whenever you notice reduced airflow, musty odors, or the filters are getting dirty faster than usual.

**How to clean:**
1. Turn off the unit and open the front panel
2. Remove the filters (clean them separately)
3. Spray no-rinse evaporator coil cleaner (Nu-Calgon, Frost King, or Web brand) evenly across the coil surface
4. Let the cleaner foam and work for 15–20 minutes — it dissolves dirt and drains through the condensate pan
5. Replace filters, close the panel, and run the unit in fan mode for 30 minutes to dry the coil

<Callout type="warning">
**Never use a pressure washer, stiff brush, or compressed air on evaporator coil fins.** The aluminum fins are extremely delicate — 0.1mm thick — and bend easily. Bent fins restrict airflow and reduce efficiency. If fins are already bent, use a fin comb ($10–$15) to straighten them.

## Condensate Drain Maintenance

The condensate drain carries moisture from the indoor unit's drip pan to the outdoors. A clogged drain causes water to back up and leak from the indoor unit — potentially damaging walls, ceilings, and flooring.

**Prevention:** Pour 1/4 cup of distilled white vinegar into the drain pan monthly during cooling season. The acidity prevents algae and mold growth.

**Clearing a clog:**
1. Locate the drain exit point outside your home
2. Attach a wet/dry vacuum to the exit and suction for 30–60 seconds
3. Check for water flow from the indoor unit — run the AC and verify water drains freely
4. If still clogged, use a thin flexible brush or compressed air (gentle) from the indoor side

## Outdoor Unit Maintenance

**Quarterly:** Check clearance — ensure at least 12 inches on all sides and 36 inches in front. Clear away plants, leaves, debris, and spider webs.

**Semi-annually:** Rinse the condenser coils with a garden hose. Spray from the inside out (through the unit, pushing dirt outward). Use gentle pressure — never a pressure washer.

**Annually:** Inspect the base pan for debris and ensure the drain holes are clear. Check that the unit is level (an unlevel unit can cause oil pooling in the compressor). Verify all mounting bolts are tight.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How often should I clean my mini split filters?",
      answer: "Every 2–4 weeks during active use. In dusty environments, homes with pets, or during high-pollen seasons, clean them every 2 weeks. Most mini split filters are washable — rinse under lukewarm water, let dry completely (2–4 hours), then reinstall. Never run the unit without filters installed, as dust will coat the evaporator coil and create mold issues."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I clean the inside of a mini split?",
      answer: "For basic cleaning: remove and wash filters, then spray no-rinse evaporator coil cleaner (like Nu-Calgon or Frost King) onto the coils. Let it sit for 15 minutes, then run the unit in fan mode for 30 minutes. For deep cleaning: remove the front panel and blower wheel cover, clean the blower wheel with a brush and coil cleaner, and rinse the drain pan. Deep cleaning is recommended every 1–2 years or when you notice musty odors."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my mini split smell musty?",
      answer: "Musty smells indicate mold or mildew growth on the evaporator coil, blower wheel, or drain pan. This happens when moisture sits on these surfaces without drying. Fix it by: running the unit in fan-only or dry mode for 30–60 minutes after each cooling session (this dries the coil), deep cleaning the coil with no-rinse cleaner, and clearing the condensate drain. Preventing it: activate the 'anti-mold' or 'self-cleaning' function if your unit has one."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I clean the outdoor unit?",
      answer: "Turn off power at the disconnect. Remove any debris (leaves, grass, spider webs) from around the unit. Use a garden hose to gently spray the condenser fins from inside out — this pushes dirt out of the fins rather than into them. Never use a pressure washer (it bends the delicate aluminum fins). Straighten any bent fins with a fin comb ($10–$15 tool). Ensure at least 12 inches of clearance on all sides."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I clear a clogged condensate drain?",
      answer: "Locate the drain line exit point (outside, near the outdoor unit or indoor unit). Use a wet/dry vacuum to suction the clog from the exit point. Alternatively, use compressed air to blow the clog out (be gentle to avoid disconnecting the line). For stubborn clogs, pour a cup of distilled white vinegar into the drain pan and let it sit for 30 minutes. Prevent clogs by flushing with vinegar monthly during cooling season."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does professional mini split maintenance cost?",
      answer: "A professional mini split cleaning and inspection costs $100–$250 per indoor unit. This typically includes filter cleaning, coil cleaning, condensate drain flush, refrigerant pressure check, electrical connection inspection, and performance testing. Annual professional service is recommended for optimal performance and to catch potential issues early."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I don't maintain my mini split?",
      answer: "Neglecting maintenance causes progressive performance degradation: 5–15% efficiency loss from dirty filters (higher electricity bills), reduced cooling/heating capacity, poor dehumidification, musty odors from mold growth, ice formation on the evaporator coil, premature compressor wear from restricted airflow, and potential water damage from clogged condensate drains. A well-maintained unit lasts 15–20 years; a neglected one may fail in 8–12 years."
    },
    {
      question: "Does my mini split need refrigerant top-ups?",
      answer: "No — a properly installed mini split is a sealed system that should never need refrigerant added. If refrigerant levels are low, there's a leak that needs to be found and repaired first. Simply adding refrigerant without fixing the leak is a temporary bandage that wastes money and harms the environment. If your unit shows signs of low refrigerant (reduced cooling, ice on coils, hissing sounds), call a technician for a leak inspection."
