# Best Cassette Ceiling Air Conditioners (Specs + Installation Guide)

Ceiling cassette mini splits mount inside the ceiling cavity with only a flush-mounted grille visible below, delivering 4-directional airflow and a nearly invisible HVAC installation. A single-zone ceiling cassette costs $2,500–$6,000 installed — 30–50% more than a wall-mount unit — but eliminates the visible indoor unit that some homeowners and businesses find objectionable.
