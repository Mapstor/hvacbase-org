 | Use 10 AWG wire, 25–30A breaker |
| 36K (240V) | 22–28A | 30–40A | Use 10 or 8 AWG wire, 30–40A breaker |

### Worked Example 1: MrCool DIY 12K

The MrCool DIY 4th Gen 12,000 BTU unit has:
- MCA: 11.5A
- MOP: 20A
- Wire requirement: 12 AWG copper, 240V
- Breaker: 20A double-pole
- Running amps: ~5.5A typical, 10A peak

Your electrician runs 12/2 Romex (or THHN in conduit) from the panel to a 60A non-fused disconnect near the outdoor unit, then from the disconnect to the unit. A 20A double-pole breaker in the panel protects the circuit.

### Worked Example 2: Mitsubishi 24K Hyper-Heat

The Mitsubishi MUZ-FH24NA outdoor unit specs:
- MCA: 20.0A
- MOP: 25A
- Wire requirement: 10 AWG copper, 240V
- Breaker: 25A double-pole
- Running amps: ~12A typical, 22A peak

This requires heavier 10/2 wire and a 25A breaker. The disconnect box must be rated for the higher amperage.

### Worked Example 3: Multi-Zone 5-Zone System

A Daikin 5-zone 48K outdoor unit:
- MCA: 27.0A
- MOP: 40A
- Wire requirement: 8 AWG copper, 240V
- Breaker: 40A double-pole
- Running amps: ~16A typical, 32A peak

This is a significant electrical load. Verify your panel has space for a 40A breaker and adequate remaining capacity.

## Electrical Disconnect Requirements

Building codes (NEC Article 440) require a disconnect switch within sight of the outdoor unit. This allows a technician to safely disconnect power while working on the unit.

| Disconnect Type | Cost | Notes |
|----------------|------|-------|
| Non-fused pullout disconnect | $15–$30 | Most common for residential mini splits |
| Fused disconnect | $25–$50 | Adds fuse protection at the unit |
| Lockable disconnect | $30–$60 | Required in some jurisdictions |

The disconnect must be mounted within 50 feet and within line-of-sight of the outdoor unit. Most installers mount it on the wall within 3–6 feet of the unit.

## Can Your Electrical Panel Handle a Mini Split?

Before installation, check whether your panel has:

**Available breaker space:** A single-zone 12K unit needs one 20A double-pole breaker slot (takes 2 spaces). A 5-zone system needs one 40A double-pole slot. Multi-zone systems with separate circuits per zone need multiple slots.

**Adequate total capacity:** A typical 200A residential panel can easily accommodate one or more mini splits. A 100A panel may be tight if you already have high-draw loads (electric dryer, EV charger, electric range, electric water heater). Add up your existing breaker ratings and ensure total doesn't approach panel capacity.

**Panel upgrade costs (if needed):** Upgrading from a 100A to 200A panel costs $1,500–$4,000 including the meter base, panel, and electrician labor. This is the most expensive electrical surprise and worth checking early in the planning process.

| Panel Size | Typical Available Capacity | Can Support |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 100A | 20–40A available | 1–2 single-zone mini splits |
| 150A | 40–60A available | 2–3 single-zone or 1 multi-zone |
| 200A | 60–100A available | Multiple mini splits, whole-home system |

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **12K mini split: 5–7 running amps**, 20A breaker, 12 AWG wire (240V)
- **24K mini split: 10–14 running amps**, 25–30A breaker, 10 AWG wire (240V)
- **Always check the nameplate** MCA and MOP values — these override general guidelines
- **Every mini split needs a dedicated circuit** — never share with other appliances
- **A disconnect switch is required** by code near the outdoor unit
- **Verify panel capacity** before installation — upgrades cost $1,500–$4,000
- **Budget $300–$800 for electrical work** per zone (circuit, breaker, disconnect, wiring)

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How many amps does a 12,000 BTU mini split use?",
      answer: "A 12,000 BTU mini split at 240V draws 5–7 amps during normal operation and 10–15 amps during startup. It requires a dedicated 20-amp circuit with 12 AWG copper wire. The exact amperage is listed on the unit's data plate as MCA (Minimum Circuit Ampacity). Always use the manufacturer's specifications for your specific model."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I plug a mini split into a regular outlet?",
      answer: "Only the smallest 120V models (6K–9K BTU) can potentially use a regular 120V outlet, and they still require a dedicated circuit. Most mini splits are 240V hardwired systems — they don't plug into an outlet at all. They're permanently wired from the breaker panel to a disconnect box to the outdoor unit. This wiring must be done by a licensed electrician."
    },
    {
      question: "Does a mini split need its own circuit breaker?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. Every mini split requires a dedicated circuit breaker — you cannot share the circuit with other appliances. This is both a code requirement (NEC) and a manufacturer requirement for warranty coverage. The breaker size is determined by the unit's MOP (Maximum Overcurrent Protection) rating listed on the nameplate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I run a mini split on a 15-amp breaker?",
      answer: "Only for the smallest units (6K–9K BTU) where the manufacturer's MOP allows a 15A breaker. Most 12K+ units require a 20A breaker minimum. Never use a smaller breaker than the manufacturer specifies — it will trip repeatedly. Never use a larger breaker than the MOP — it creates a fire hazard."
    },
    {
      question: "What wire size do I need for a mini split?",
      answer: "For most 9K–15K units at 240V: 12 AWG copper. For 18K–24K units: 10 AWG copper. For 30K–36K units: 10 or 8 AWG copper. The exact requirement is determined by the MCA value on the unit's nameplate. The wire must be rated for at least the MCA value. Use the NEC ampacity tables or consult your electrician."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to run the electrical for a mini split?",
      answer: "A licensed electrician typically charges $300–$800 per zone for the complete electrical package: breaker, wire run from panel to disconnect, disconnect box, and wire from disconnect to unit. Costs vary based on distance from the panel, wire gauge needed, panel complexity, and local labor rates. If a panel upgrade is needed, add $1,500–$4,000."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I run multiple mini splits on one circuit?",
      answer: "No. Each mini split outdoor unit requires its own dedicated circuit. This is both a code requirement and a practical necessity — the startup current of one unit could trip a shared breaker. Multi-zone systems with one outdoor unit need one circuit for the outdoor unit. If you install multiple single-zone systems, each needs its own circuit."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a GFCI breaker for a mini split?",
      answer: "The 2023 NEC update expanded GFCI requirements, but most mini splits are 240V-only circuits that may be exempt depending on your local code adoption. Some jurisdictions now require GFCI protection for all outdoor equipment. GFCI breakers for 240V circuits cost $40–$80 more than standard breakers. Check with your electrician and local code authority."
