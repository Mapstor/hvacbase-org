# Best Mini Split for Garage (1-Car, 2-Car, 3-Car Sizing Guide)

A 2-car garage (400–500 sq ft) typically needs an 18,000–24,000 BTU mini split for cooling and heating, costing $1,500–$4,000 installed depending on insulation level and brand choice. The best garage mini split is the MrCool DIY 4th Gen — its DIY installation saves $1,000–$2,500 in a space where premium noise levels and build quality matter less than in a bedroom or living room.

## Garage BTU Sizing Guide

Garages have unique sizing challenges: they're often poorly insulated, have large door openings, contain heat-generating equipment, and experience massive temperature swings. Standard residential BTU calculations undersize for garages.

| Garage Type | Size (sq ft) | Insulated | Recommended BTU | Recommended Unit |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1-car | 200–300 | No | 12,000–15,000 | 12K or 15K |
| 1-car | 200–300 | Yes | 9,000–12,000 | 9K or 12K |
| 2-car | 400–500 | No | 18,000–24,000 | 18K or 24K |
| 2-car | 400–500 | Yes | 12,000–18,000 | 12K or 18K |
| 3-car | 600–800 | No | 24,000–36,000 | 24K or 36K |
| 3-car | 600–800 | Yes | 18,000–24,000 | 18K or 24K |

### Worked Example: Uninsulated 2-Car Garage in Dallas, TX

- Garage: 450 sq ft, uninsulated walls, single-pane windows, 10-ft ceilings
- Base: 450 × 30 = 13,500 BTU
- Uninsulated: +30% → +4,050 BTU
- High ceilings: +25% → +3,375 BTU
- Hot climate: +15% → +2,025 BTU
- Adjusted: 22,950 BTU
- **Recommended: 24,000 BTU unit**

### Worked Example: Insulated 1-Car Garage in Portland, OR

- Garage: 250 sq ft, insulated walls, 8-ft ceilings
- Base: 250 × 30 = 7,500 BTU
- Good insulation: no adjustment
