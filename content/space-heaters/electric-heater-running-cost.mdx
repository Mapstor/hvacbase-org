# How Much Does It Cost to Run an Electric Heater? (2026 Calculator)

**A 1,500-watt electric space heater costs between $0.12 and $0.36 per hour to run, depending on your local electricity rate.** At the 2026 U.S. national average of $0.168/kWh, that's $0.252 per hour, $2.02 per 8-hour day, or $60.48 per month running 8 hours daily. Your actual cost depends on three variables: wattage, electricity rate, and hours of use.

The formula is simple, but the devil is in the details — your state's electricity rate can make the same heater cost 3× more in one place than another.

<TableOfContents />

## The Electric Heater Cost Formula

Every electric heater cost calculation uses this formula:

**Cost = (Watts ÷ 1,000) × Electricity Rate ($/kWh) × Hours of Use**

That's it. There's no efficiency variable because all electric resistance heaters convert electricity to heat at ~100% efficiency. A cheap $30 heater and an expensive $150 heater both cost the same to run at the same wattage.

<Callout type="info">
**Where to find your electricity rate:** Check your most recent utility bill. Look for "price per kWh" or "energy charge." It's typically listed in cents per kilowatt-hour (e.g., 16.8¢/kWh = $0.168/kWh). You can also find your state's average at the EIA's electricity data page.

### Cost by State: How Location Changes Everything

Electricity rates vary enormously across the U.S. Running the exact same 1,500W heater for 8 hours costs $1.20 in Louisiana but $4.00+ in Massachusetts.

<ComparisonTable

/>

<Callout type="warning">
**High-rate state alert:** If you live in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, or Hawaii, a space heater is an expensive way to heat. At $0.30+/kWh, a 1,500W heater costs over $100/month for 8 hours/day. In these states, a heat pump or gas supplemental heating is almost always a better financial choice.
</Callout>

## How ECO Mode and Thermostats Reduce Costs

The numbers above assume continuous, full-power operation. In practice, a heater with a thermostat or ECO mode draws significantly less power because it cycles on and off.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Actual vs. Maximum Cost (1,500W Heater, 8 Hours, $0.168/kWh)"
  headers={["Operating Mode", "Avg. Power Draw", "8-Hour Cost", "Monthly Cost", "vs. Full Blast"]}
  rows={[
    ["Full blast (no thermostat)", "1,500W constant", "$2.02", "$60.48", "Baseline"],
    ["Thermostat (well-insulated room)", "~900W average", "$1.21", "$36.29", "40% less"],
    ["ECO mode (well-insulated)", "~700W average", "$0.94", "$28.22", "53% less"],
    ["ECO mode (average insulation)", "~1,000W average", "$1.34", "$40.32", "33% less"],
    ["ECO mode (poor insulation)", "~1,300W average", "$1.75", "$52.42", "13% less"],
    ["750W setting (manual)", "750W constant", "$1.01", "$30.24", "50% less"]
  ]}
/>

The message is clear: a heater with ECO mode in a well-insulated room can cost nearly half of one running full blast in a drafty room.

Electric resistance heating (which includes all space heaters) is the most expensive common heating method per BTU. The only scenario where it's cost-effective is when you're heating a single small room while reducing central heat — the zone heating strategy.

## Real-World Cost Examples

### Example 1: Supplementing Central Heat in a Home Office

**Setup:** Amanda in Denver, CO works from home in a 150 sq ft office. She lowers the thermostat from 72°F to 64°F and runs a 1,500W oil-filled radiator with ECO mode for 8 hours.

- Electricity rate: $0.15/kWh
- Space heater (ECO mode, avg. 850W): 6.8 kWh/day × $0.15 = **$1.02/day ($30.60/month)**
- Gas savings from lowering thermostat 8°F: ~10% of $160 gas bill = **$16/month saved**
- **Net cost increase: ~$14.60/month** for a warm office while saving on whole-house heating

### Example 2: All-Night Bedroom Heating

**Setup:** Carlos in Chicago has a drafty 200 sq ft bedroom. He runs a 1,500W heater for 10 hours overnight (10 PM – 8 AM) on a timer.

- Rate: $0.17/kWh
- Full-blast cost: 15 kWh × $0.17 = **$2.55/night ($76.50/month)**
- With thermostat + ECO (avg. 1,100W): 11 kWh × $0.17 = **$1.87/night ($56.10/month)**
- **Winter season (5 months): $280–$382**

### Example 3: High-Rate State Sticker Shock

**Setup:** Lisa in San Jose, CA uses a 1,500W ceramic heater in her apartment for 6 hours/day.

- Rate: $0.32/kWh (PG&E Tier 2)
- Daily cost: 9 kWh × $0.32 = **$2.88/day ($86.40/month)**
- With a portable heat pump (COP 2.5, same 6 hours): ~3.6 kWh × $0.32 = **$1.15/day ($34.56/month)**
- **Savings from switching to heat pump: $51.84/month ($259 per season)**

### Example 4: Multiple Heater Household

**Setup:** The Kim family in Portland, OR runs heaters in 3 rooms: a 1,500W in the living room (5 hrs), a 1,000W in a kid's bedroom (8 hrs), and a 750W in a home office (6 hrs).

- Rate: $0.12/kWh
- Living room: 7.5 kWh × $0.12 = $0.90
- Bedroom: 8 kWh × $0.12 = $0.96
- Office: 4.5 kWh × $0.12 = $0.54
- **Total daily: $2.40 | Monthly: $72.00 | Winter season: $360**

At $72/month for three heaters, they should compare this to their central heating cost. If gas central heat for the whole house costs $120/month, running three space heaters plus lowering the furnace may not save money.

## Tips to Lower Your Electric Heater Costs

1. **Use ECO mode or a thermostat** — saves 20–50% vs. constant full power.
2. **Right-size your wattage** — use 750W for small rooms, 1,000W for medium, 1,500W only for large spaces.
3. **Set a timer** — avoid running while sleeping or away. Even 2 fewer hours/day saves $15–$30/month.
4. **Seal the room** — close doors, use draft stoppers, apply window film. A sealed room needs less heater runtime.
5. **Use infrared for personal heating** — a 400W infrared desk heater warms you directly at 1/4 the cost of a 1,500W room heater.
6. **Check for time-of-use rates** — some utilities charge less for overnight electricity. Pair with an oil-filled radiator for thermal storage.
7. **Consider a heat pump** — for regular use, a $400–$700 portable heat pump cuts costs by 50–70%.

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Key Takeaways:**
- Formula: Cost = (Watts ÷ 1,000) × $/kWh × Hours. A 1,500W heater at $0.168/kWh = $0.25/hour.
- Monthly costs at 8 hrs/day range from $36 (Louisiana) to $155 (Hawaii) for a 1,500W heater.
- ECO mode can cut costs by 30–50% in well-insulated rooms.
- Electric resistance heating is the most expensive per BTU. It only saves money as a zone-heating supplement.
- In high-rate states ($0.25+/kWh), a portable heat pump is a much cheaper heating option.
- Always check your actual kWh rate on your utility bill — state averages may not reflect your plan.

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How much electricity does a 1500 watt heater use per hour?",
    answer: "A 1,500-watt heater uses exactly 1.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per hour when running at full power. At the U.S. average rate of $0.168/kWh, that costs $0.252 per hour. With ECO mode or a thermostat, actual consumption is lower because the heater cycles on and off — typically averaging 0.7–1.2 kWh per hour."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a space heater use a lot of electricity?",
    answer: "A 1,500W space heater running 8 hours/day uses 12 kWh daily — roughly the same as running a refrigerator, a TV, and 10 LED bulbs combined for 24 hours. Over a month at 8 hrs/day, it adds 360 kWh to your bill, costing $36–$155 depending on your state's rates. That's significant — about a 25–40% increase on the average monthly electric bill."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it cheaper to run a space heater or central heat?",
    answer: "It depends on your fuel source and how many rooms you're heating. Heating one room with a 1,500W space heater while lowering gas central heat by 10°F typically saves money. Heating 3+ rooms with space heaters is almost always more expensive than gas central heat. For all-electric homes, a space heater in one room while reducing central electric heat saves money."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run a space heater all day?",
    answer: "At the U.S. average rate of $0.168/kWh, a 1,500W heater running 24 hours straight costs $6.05. Per month (30 days), that's $181.44. In practice, no one needs to run a heater 24/7 — using ECO mode and a timer for 8–12 hours reduces the cost to $40–$90/month."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run a 750 watt heater?",
    answer: "A 750W heater costs exactly half of a 1,500W heater: $0.126/hour at the U.S. average rate. Running 8 hours/day costs $1.01/day or $30.24/month. A 750W heater is sufficient for well-insulated rooms up to 100 sq ft and is the most cost-effective setting for small spaces."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I reduce my space heater electricity cost?",
    answer: "The most effective strategies in order: (1) Use ECO mode (saves 20–50%), (2) use the lowest wattage that keeps you comfortable, (3) set a timer to avoid running when not needed, (4) seal the room (draft stoppers, window film), (5) use infrared for personal spot heating instead of room heating, (6) consider switching to a portable heat pump for 50–70% savings."
  },
  {
    question: "Are some space heaters cheaper to run than others?",
    answer: "At the same wattage, all electric space heaters cost exactly the same to run — a watt is a watt regardless of heater type. The cost differences come from features: ECO modes, accurate thermostats, and smart controls that reduce runtime. An oil-filled radiator with ECO mode may cost 30–40% less per month than a basic ceramic heater running full blast, even though both are rated at 1,500W."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does an oil-filled heater cost to run?",
    answer: "An oil-filled heater costs the same per hour as any electric heater at the same wattage: $0.25/hour for 1,500W at $0.168/kWh. However, oil-filled heaters with ECO mode tend to cost less in practice because the oil's thermal mass reduces cycling. Expect 20–40% less monthly cost compared to a heater running continuously."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a space heater more expensive than baseboard heating?",
    answer: "They cost exactly the same per kWh because both use electric resistance. A 1,500W space heater and a 1,500W baseboard heater produce identical heat at identical cost. The advantage of a space heater is portability — you move it to where you are. Baseboards heat the whole room whether you're there or not."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cheapest electric heater to run?",
    answer: "The cheapest electric heater to run is the one with the lowest wattage that keeps you comfortable. A 400W infrared desk heater costs $0.07/hour vs. $0.25/hour for a 1,500W room heater — 73% less. If you need room heating, the cheapest operating option is an oil-filled radiator with ECO mode in a well-insulated room, which averages 600–800W actual draw."
