# What Size Mini Split for a Garage? (1-Car, 2-Car, 3-Car)

**A 1-car garage needs a 9,000–12,000 BTU mini split, a 2-car garage needs 18,000–24,000 BTU, and a 3-car garage needs 24,000–36,000 BTU — but insulation level is the deciding factor that can shift these numbers by 40%.** An insulated, sealed 2-car garage can get by with an 18,000 BTU unit, while an uninsulated 2-car garage with a leaky door in Phoenix might need 30,000 BTU or more.

Garages are uniquely challenging to condition: large overhead doors with minimal insulation, concrete slab floors that absorb heat, poor air sealing, and often no insulation in walls or ceiling. This guide accounts for all of these factors.

## Garage Mini Split Sizing Chart

| Garage Type | Size (sq ft) | Insulated + Sealed | Insulated Only | Uninsulated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-car | 200–300 | 9,000 BTU | 12,000 BTU | 12,000–15,000 BTU |
| 1.5-car | 300–400 | 12,000 BTU | 12,000–15,000 BTU | 15,000–18,000 BTU |
| 2-car | 400–576 | 18,000 BTU | 18,000–24,000 BTU | 24,000–30,000 BTU |
| 2.5-car | 576–700 | 18,000–24,000 BTU | 24,000 BTU | 30,000 BTU |
| 3-car | 700–900 | 24,000 BTU | 24,000–30,000 BTU | 30,000–36,000 BTU |
| 3-car deep/tandem | 900–1,200 | 30,000–36,000 BTU | 36,000 BTU | 36,000–48,000 BTU (2 units) |

**"Insulated + Sealed" means:** R-13+ walls, R-30+ ceiling, insulated garage door (R-8+), weather stripping on all door edges, and sealed gaps/penetrations. This is the gold standard for a conditioned garage and reduces your required BTU by 30–40% compared to uninsulated. The garage door insulation alone makes the biggest single difference.
</Callout>

## Why Garages Need More BTU Per Square Foot

Regular rooms need 18–25 BTU per square foot. Garages need 30–55 BTU per square foot because of several compounding factors:

| Factor | Impact on Cooling Load |
|---|---|
| Garage door (uninsulated) | +25–40% — a standard steel door is R-0 to R-2 |
| Garage door (insulated, R-8+) | +10–15% — much better but still the weakest wall |
| Concrete slab (full sun) | +10–15% — absorbs and radiates heat for hours |
| No wall insulation | +20–30% — exposed studs and single-layer siding |
| Poor air sealing | +15–25% — gaps around door, windows, and penetrations |
| Dark roof directly above | +10–20% — radiant heat from roof deck |
| Frequently opened door | +10–20% — every opening floods in outdoor air |

A fully uninsulated garage in Zone 2 (Phoenix, Houston) can require 50–60 BTU per square foot — nearly 3× the standard residential rate.

## Climate Zone Adjustments for Garages

| Climate Zone | Cooling Multiplier | Heating Multiplier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zone 2 (Hot) | 1.25–1.40 | 0.80 | Extreme summer heat in garages |
| Zone 3 (Warm) | 1.10–1.25 | 0.90–1.00 | Near-baseline |
| Zone 4 (Mixed) | 1.00 | 1.00–1.10 | Balanced needs |
| Zone 5 (Cool) | 0.90 | 1.15–1.30 | Heating dominates |
| Zone 6 (Cold) | 0.85 | 1.30–1.50 | Must use cold-climate mini split |
| Zone 7 (Very Cold) | 0.80 | 1.50–1.80 | May need supplemental heat |

## Sizing Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: 2-car garage workshop in Austin, TX (Zone 2)**

Dimensions: 20' × 24' = 480 sq ft. Walls insulated (R-13), ceiling insulated (R-19), insulated garage door (R-8). Weather-stripped but door opens 2–3 times daily. Workshop use: table saw, compressor, lighting (1,500W equipment heat).

Calculation: 480 × 35 BTU/sq ft (Zone 2, insulated garage) = 16,800. Equipment heat: +5,000 BTU. Frequent door opening: +15% = 25,070 BTU.

**Recommendation: 24,000 BTU (2-ton) mini split.** A Mitsubishi MSZ-GL24NA or equivalent handles this load with margin for Austin's 105°F peak days. Total installed cost: $2,800–$4,200.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: 1-car garage gym in Charlotte, NC (Zone 3)**

Dimensions: 12' × 20' = 240 sq ft. Uninsulated walls and ceiling. Basic non-insulated garage door. One person exercising (1,200–1,800 BTU body heat during workouts).

Calculation: 240 × 45 BTU/sq ft (Zone 3, uninsulated) = 10,800. Body heat during exercise: +1,500 BTU = 12,300 BTU.

**Recommendation: 12,000 BTU (1-ton) mini split.** Perfect match. For year-round gym use, choose a heat pump mini split rated to at least 17°F for Charlotte's winter design temperature. A Fujitsu 12RLS3Y or Mitsubishi MSZ-GL12NA handles both heating and cooling.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: 3-car insulated garage in Denver, CO (Zone 5)**

Dimensions: 32' × 24' = 768 sq ft. Fully insulated (R-13 walls, R-38 ceiling, R-12 garage door). Well-sealed. Used as car storage + occasional workshop. Main concern: heating in winter.

Cooling: 768 × 28 BTU/sq ft = 21,504 BTU. Heating: 768 × 50 BTU/sq ft (Zone 5 garage) = 38,400 BTU. Cold-climate HP capacity at 5°F: a 30K unit delivers ~22,000 BTU.

**Recommendation: 36,000 BTU (3-ton) cold-climate mini split.** The heating load drives the sizing. A 36K cold-climate unit delivers approximately 28,000 BTU at 5°F outdoor temp — covering 73% of the heating load. For the coldest days, supplement with a 1,500W portable heater or accept slightly lower garage temperatures.

Alternatively, two 18,000 BTU heads provide better air distribution in the 768 sq ft space.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 4: Detached uninsulated 2-car garage in Miami, FL (Zone 1)**

Dimensions: 22' × 22' = 484 sq ft. Zero insulation. Metal roof. No weather stripping. Dark-colored exterior. Used as workspace 6+ hours daily.

Calculation: 484 × 55 BTU/sq ft (Zone 1, uninsulated, metal roof penalty) = 26,620 BTU.

**Recommendation: 30,000 BTU mini split — OR — insulate first, then 18,000 BTU.**

Insulating the garage (walls + ceiling + door) for $2,000–$3,500 drops the required BTU to approximately 16,000–18,000, allowing an 18K unit instead of 30K. The 18K unit costs $1,000+ less to purchase and $100–$200/year less to operate. In this case, insulating first saves money compared to upsizing the mini split.
</Callout>

## Insulate First, Then Size: The Cost-Effective Approach

| Insulation Upgrade | Typical Cost | BTU Reduction | Payback Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| Garage door insulation kit (R-8) | $100–$300 | 20–30% | 1–2 years |
| Wall insulation (R-13 batts) | $500–$1,500 | 15–25% | 2–3 years |
| Ceiling insulation (R-30) | $400–$1,200 | 10–20% | 2–3 years |
| Weather stripping (all doors) | $50–$150 | 10–15% | <1 year |
| **Total package** | **$1,050–$3,150** | **40–60%** | **1.5–3 years** |

Every dollar spent on insulation reduces the required mini split size (saving $200–$1,000 on equipment) and reduces annual operating costs ($50–$150/year). For uninsulated garages, insulating before installing a mini split almost always makes financial sense.

## Garage Heating: Winter Sizing Considerations

If you're using your garage mini split for heating too (workshop, gym, living space conversion), the heating load often exceeds the cooling load in Zones 4–7.

| Garage Type | Zone 4 Heating BTU | Zone 5 Heating BTU | Zone 6 Heating BTU |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-car insulated | 10,000–14,000 | 14,000–18,000 | 18,000–24,000 |
| 2-car insulated | 18,000–24,000 | 24,000–36,000 | 36,000–48,000 |
| 3-car insulated | 28,000–36,000 | 36,000–48,000 | 48,000+ (2 units) |
| 1-car uninsulated | 15,000–20,000 | 20,000–30,000 | Not practical |
| 2-car uninsulated | 28,000–40,000 | 40,000–60,000 | Not practical |

<Callout type="warning">
**Heating an uninsulated garage in cold climates is extremely expensive.** The heat loss through uninsulated walls, ceiling, and especially the garage door is enormous. A mini split running full-blast in an uninsulated 2-car garage in Zone 6 can cost $200–$400/month in electricity. Insulate the garage before attempting to heat it.
</Callout>

## Mini Split Placement in Garages

For single-head installations, mount the indoor unit on the wall opposite the garage door, 7–8 feet high. This creates the longest air throw across the space, pushing conditioned air toward the door (the biggest heat gain source) and ensuring even distribution.

For 3-car garages or deep garages over 30 feet, consider two indoor heads: one on each side wall or one mid-depth on each side. A single head struggles to condition a space more than 25 feet from the unit.

The outdoor unit should be mounted on an exterior wall or a ground stand, avoiding the south/west side of the building (which gets the hottest sun exposure) when possible. Ensure at least 24 inches of clearance around the outdoor unit for airflow.

**Key Takeaways**

1. Standard sizes: 1-car = 9K–12K BTU, 2-car = 18K–24K BTU, 3-car = 24K–36K BTU. Insulation level shifts these by ±40%
2. Garages need 30–55 BTU/sq ft — 1.5–2.5× more than regular rooms — due to doors, slab, and poor insulation
3. Insulating first (especially the garage door) reduces required mini split size by 30–40% and saves money long-term
4. For year-round use in Zones 5+, choose cold-climate mini splits and size for the heating load
5. In hot climates with uninsulated garages, spend the money on insulation rather than upsizing the mini split
6. Two smaller heads beat one large head for garages over 700 sq ft or deeper than 30 feet

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ>
  <FAQ.Item question="What size mini split for a 2-car garage?">
    An insulated 2-car garage (400–576 sq ft) needs an 18,000–24,000 BTU mini split. An uninsulated 2-car garage needs 24,000–30,000 BTU. The garage door insulation level makes the biggest difference. In hot climates, add 15–25%. For heating in cold climates, the size may increase by 50–80% because of the large heat loss through the door and walls.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is a mini split worth it for a garage?">
    Yes, if you use the garage regularly as a workshop, gym, office, or living space. A mini split costs $2,000–$4,500 installed and provides both heating and cooling with high efficiency. It's more cost-effective than portable AC units (which waste 30–40% of their cooling) and more permanent than space heaters. For occasional use (parking cars only), it's not worth the investment.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can I use a mini split in an uninsulated garage?">
    You can, but it's wasteful. Without insulation, the mini split works 40–60% harder to maintain temperature, drastically increasing energy costs and equipment wear. The better approach: spend $1,000–$3,000 insulating the garage first, then install a smaller (cheaper) mini split. The insulation pays for itself within 2–3 years through energy savings and allows a $500–$1,000 cheaper mini split unit.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does it cost to install a mini split in a garage?">
    A single-zone garage mini split costs $2,000–$4,500 installed in 2026, including the indoor head, outdoor unit, refrigerant lines, electrical work, and labor. Factors that increase cost: longer line set runs (detached garages), electrical panel upgrades, cold-climate models (+$300–$500), and premium brands. DIY mini split kits (MrCool, Pioneer) cost $1,000–$2,000 but void many manufacturer warranties.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Should I insulate my garage door before installing a mini split?">
    Absolutely. The garage door is the single largest source of heat gain/loss, and insulating it (R-8+ kit for $100–$300) reduces your required mini split size by 20–30%. An insulated door also reduces noise, prevents condensation, and improves the garage's year-round comfort even without AC. It's the highest-ROI upgrade for any conditioned garage.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can one mini split heat and cool a garage?">
    Yes, a mini split heat pump provides both heating and cooling. For garages in Zones 1–4, a standard mini split handles both seasons. In Zones 5–7, choose a cold-climate model rated to −13°F or below. Even cold-climate units may not fully heat an uninsulated garage on the coldest days — supplemental heating (portable electric heater, infrared panel) may be needed for the extremes.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size mini split for a 1-car garage gym?">
    A 1-car garage gym (200–300 sq ft) needs a 12,000 BTU mini split if insulated, or 15,000 BTU if uninsulated. Add 1,200–1,800 BTU for intense exercise body heat. A 12K unit is the most common and cost-effective choice. For cold-climate heating (gym in winter), ensure the unit is cold-climate rated and size for the heating load, which may push you to 15,000–18,000 BTU.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Where should I mount the mini split in my garage?">
    Mount the indoor head on the wall opposite the garage door, 7–8 feet high. This pushes conditioned air across the longest dimension of the garage toward the door. Avoid mounting directly above a workbench or seating area — the direct airflow can be uncomfortably cold. The outdoor unit goes on an exterior wall with 24+ inches of clearance, preferably on the north or east side to avoid direct afternoon sun.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do I need a permit for a garage mini split?">
    In most jurisdictions, yes. Mini split installation involves electrical work (dedicated 240V circuit) and refrigerant handling (requiring EPA Section 608 certification). Many cities require a building permit and/or electrical permit. Check with your local building department. Installing without a permit can void insurance coverage and create problems when selling your home.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Mini split vs. window AC for a garage?">
    A mini split is better for garages used regularly: it's more efficient (SEER2 18–33 vs CEER 10–12), quieter (19–28 dB vs 50+ dB), provides heating, and doesn't occupy a window. A window AC is cheaper ($200–$500 vs $2,000–$4,500) and makes sense for occasional cooling in a garage you only use a few hours per week. For daily-use workshops, gyms, or offices, the mini split's superior efficiency and comfort justify the higher upfront cost.
