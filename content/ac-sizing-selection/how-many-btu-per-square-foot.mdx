# How Many BTU Per Square Foot for Heating & Cooling?

**For cooling, you need 20 BTU per square foot as a baseline. For heating, you need 30–60 BTU per square foot depending on climate zone.** These are starting points only — your actual number can vary by 40–60% based on insulation quality, ceiling height, window area, and eight other factors that this guide covers in detail.

The BTU-per-square-foot metric is the quickest way to estimate HVAC sizing, and it's the first number every contractor calculates. But using the wrong multiplier for your specific situation leads to oversized or undersized equipment that costs hundreds extra per year. Here's how to find your exact number.

<TableOfContents />

## Cooling BTU Per Square Foot: Complete Breakdown

### The Baseline: 20 BTU/sq ft

ENERGY STAR and the DOE use 20 BTU per square foot as the standard cooling baseline. This assumes a home in DOE Climate Zone 4 (mixed climate) with average insulation, 8-foot ceilings, standard window area, and 2 occupants.

### BTU Per Square Foot by Climate Zone (Cooling)

| DOE Climate Zone | States/Regions | BTU/sq ft for Cooling | Example: 1,500 sq ft Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zone 1 (Hot-Humid) | South FL, Hawaii, US territories | 25–30 | 37,500–45,000 BTU |
| Zone 2 (Hot) | Houston, Phoenix, New Orleans, Tampa | 22–28 | 33,000–42,000 BTU |
| Zone 3 (Warm) | Atlanta, Dallas, Las Vegas, Charlotte | 20–25 | 30,000–37,500 BTU |
| Zone 4 (Mixed) | Nashville, St. Louis, DC, Albuquerque | 18–22 | 27,000–33,000 BTU |
| Zone 5 (Cool) | Chicago, Denver, Boston, Pittsburgh | 16–20 | 24,000–30,000 BTU |
| Zone 6 (Cold) | Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Burlington | 14–18 | 21,000–27,000 BTU |
| Zone 7 (Very Cold) | Duluth, Fargo, Fairbanks | 12–16 | 18,000–24,000 BTU |

The range within each zone accounts for insulation quality. Use the lower end for well-insulated, newer homes and the upper end for older, poorly insulated homes.

### BTU Per Square Foot by Insulation Level (Cooling)

Insulation is the second-largest factor after climate zone.

| Insulation Quality | BTU/sq ft Adjustment | Effective BTU/sq ft (Zone 4 baseline) |
|---|---|---|
| Poor (no wall insulation, single pane) | +30% | 26 |
| Below average | +15% | 23 |
| Average (code minimum) | 0% | 20 |
| Good (above code) | −10% | 18 |
| Excellent (high-performance) | −20% | 16 |
| Passive house | −40% | 12 |

A passive house in Climate Zone 5 might need only 8–10 BTU per square foot for cooling — less than half the standard baseline. Meanwhile, an uninsulated 1960s ranch in Zone 2 might need 32–35 BTU per square foot.

## Heating BTU Per Square Foot: Complete Breakdown

Heating requirements are more variable than cooling because the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors is much larger in winter (60–90°F gap) than in summer (15–30°F gap).

### BTU Per Square Foot by Climate Zone (Heating)

| DOE Climate Zone | States/Regions | BTU/sq ft for Heating | Example: 2,000 sq ft Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zone 1 (Hot-Humid) | South FL, Hawaii | 10–15 | 20,000–30,000 BTU |
| Zone 2 (Hot) | Houston, Phoenix, New Orleans | 15–25 | 30,000–50,000 BTU |
| Zone 3 (Warm) | Atlanta, Dallas, Las Vegas | 25–35 | 50,000–70,000 BTU |
| Zone 4 (Mixed) | Nashville, St. Louis, DC | 30–45 | 60,000–90,000 BTU |
| Zone 5 (Cool) | Chicago, Denver, Boston | 40–55 | 80,000–110,000 BTU |
| Zone 6 (Cold) | Minneapolis, Milwaukee | 50–65 | 100,000–130,000 BTU |
| Zone 7 (Very Cold) | Duluth, Fargo, Fairbanks | 60–80 | 120,000–160,000 BTU |

### Heating vs. Cooling: Which Drives Your System Size?

In most of the US, heating load drives system size because the winter temperature differential is larger. Here's where each dominates:

| Scenario | Dominant Load | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Zones 1–2 (hot climates) | Cooling | Mild winters, brutal summers |
| Zone 3 (warm) | Cooling (usually) | Close to balanced |
| Zone 4 (mixed) | Varies by home | True mixed climate |
| Zones 5–7 (cool to very cold) | Heating | Severe winters dominate |
| High solar gain (large west windows) | Cooling (even in cold zones) | Solar heat adds significantly to cooling load |
| Well-insulated new build, any zone | May be balanced | Low loads both ways |

For heat pump sizing, this matters especially — the same unit provides both heating and cooling, so you size for the larger of the two loads.

## Room-Specific BTU Per Square Foot

Different rooms within the same home have different BTU requirements:

| Room Type | Cooling BTU/sq ft | Heating BTU/sq ft | Why Different |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bedroom | 18–22 | 30–40 | Lower occupancy, smaller windows |
| Living room | 20–25 | 30–45 | More occupants, electronics |
| Kitchen | 25–35 | 25–35 | Cooking heat reduces heating need, increases cooling need |
| Sunroom/conservatory | 30–45 | 40–60 | Extreme glass area |
| Basement (finished) | 10–15 | 20–30 | Ground-coupled, naturally cool |
| Attic/bonus room | 28–40 | 45–65 | Roof exposure |
| Garage (insulated) | 25–35 | 35–55 | Minimal insulation, door losses |
| Home office | 22–28 | 30–40 | Computer equipment adds heat |
| Bathroom | 20–25 | 35–45 | Humidity concerns, comfort expectations |

<Callout type="tip">
**Zoning tip:** If you're using mini splits or a zoned system, size each zone based on its room-specific BTU per square foot — not the whole-home average. A sunroom might need 2–3× the BTU/sq ft of a basement room directly below it.
</Callout>

## Commercial and Non-Residential BTU Per Square Foot

For comparison, commercial HVAC sizing metrics differ significantly from residential:

| Building Type | Cooling BTU/sq ft | Heating BTU/sq ft | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Office (standard) | 25–35 | 25–35 | High occupancy, equipment loads |
| Office (server room) | 100–300 | 0–10 | Equipment heat dominates |
| Retail store | 30–45 | 25–35 | Open doors, high foot traffic |
| Restaurant | 40–60 | 30–40 | Kitchen heat, high occupancy |
| Church/assembly | 30–50 | 25–40 | Variable occupancy spikes |
| Hospital | 40–60 | 35–50 | 24/7 operation, strict codes |
| Warehouse | 5–15 | 10–25 | Minimal conditioning |
| Data center | 200–500 | 0 | Cooling only, massive heat loads |

## Factors That Change Your BTU Per Square Foot Number

Here's a consolidated reference of all factors and their impact:

| Factor | Cooling Impact | Heating Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Climate zone | ±30% | ±60% |
| Insulation quality | ±30% | ±40% |
| Ceiling height (9–12 ft) | +12% to +50% | +12% to +50% |
| Window area and orientation | ±20% | ±20% |
| Air sealing | ±15% | ±20% |
| Ductwork condition | ±20% | ±20% |
| Floor level (upper vs. lower) | ±25% | ±15% |
| Occupancy | +5–10% | +5–10% (body heat helps in winter) |
| Shade/landscaping | ±15% | ±5% (less impact in winter) |
| Humidity level | ±15% | ±5% |
| Appliances/equipment | +5–15% | +5% (equipment heat helps in winter) |

When multiple factors compound, the total adjustment can be dramatic. A worst-case home (hot climate, poor insulation, upper floor, unshaded, leaky ducts) might need 40+ BTU/sq ft for cooling. A best-case home (mild climate, excellent insulation, shaded, tight envelope) might need only 10–12 BTU/sq ft.

## How to Use BTU Per Square Foot for Quick Sizing

### Method 1: Simple Multiply

The fastest approach — multiply your square footage by your climate zone's midpoint BTU/sq ft value.

**2,000 sq ft × 20 BTU/sq ft = 40,000 BTU cooling capacity needed**

This gets you within 20% of the right answer for an average home. Good enough for budget planning, not precise enough for equipment selection.

### Method 2: Adjusted Multiply

Start with the climate zone value, then apply the top 3 adjustment factors (insulation, ceiling height, windows).

**2,000 sq ft × 22 BTU/sq ft (Zone 3) × 1.15 (below-avg insulation) × 1.12 (9-ft ceilings) × 1.10 (large windows) = 62,340 BTU**

This gets you within 10% for most homes and is suitable for selecting equipment size ranges.

### Method 3: Full Calculation

Use all 11 factors from our BTU calculator guide. This gets you within 5–10% of a professional Manual J calculation and is suitable for final equipment selection.

<Callout type="example">
**Quick comparison: Same 2,000 sq ft home in Atlanta (Zone 3), 9-ft ceilings, below-average insulation, large windows**

| Method | Cooling BTU Result | Accuracy vs Manual J |
|---|---|---|
| Simple (20 BTU/sq ft) | 40,000 BTU | ±20% |
| Adjusted (zone + 3 factors) | 62,340 BTU | ±10% |
| Full calculation (all 11 factors) | 58,000 BTU | ±5–10% |
| Professional Manual J | 55,200 BTU | Reference standard |

The simple method undersized by 27%. The adjusted method was within 13%. The full calculation was within 5%. All three methods took less than 5 minutes — the Manual J took 2–4 hours and cost $300–$500.

## BTU Per Square Foot for Specific Home Sizes

Here's a quick reference for the most commonly searched home sizes:

| Home Size | Cooling BTU (Zone 3–4 avg) | Cooling Tonnage | Heating BTU (Zone 5 avg) | Furnace Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 500 sq ft | 10,000–12,000 | 1 ton | 20,000–30,000 | 40,000 input |
| 750 sq ft | 15,000–18,000 | 1.5 ton | 30,000–40,000 | 40,000–60,000 |
| 1,000 sq ft | 20,000–24,000 | 2 ton | 40,000–55,000 | 60,000–80,000 |
| 1,200 sq ft | 24,000–28,000 | 2–2.5 ton | 48,000–66,000 | 60,000–80,000 |
| 1,500 sq ft | 30,000–36,000 | 2.5–3 ton | 60,000–82,500 | 80,000–100,000 |
| 2,000 sq ft | 40,000–48,000 | 3.5–4 ton | 80,000–110,000 | 100,000–120,000 |
| 2,500 sq ft | 50,000–60,000 | 4–5 ton | 100,000–137,500 | 120,000–140,000 |
| 3,000 sq ft | 60,000–72,000 | 5–6 ton | 120,000–165,000 | 140,000–2 units |
| 3,500 sq ft | 70,000–84,000 | 6–7 ton | 140,000–192,500 | 2 units typical |
| 4,000 sq ft | 80,000–96,000 | 7–8 ton | 160,000–220,000 | 2 units typical |

<Callout type="info">
**Why ranges?** The spread within each home size reflects the impact of insulation, climate zone, ceiling height, and other factors. A well-insulated 2,000 sq ft home might need the same cooling capacity as a poorly insulated 1,200 sq ft home. Your specific number depends on your home's characteristics.
</Callout>

## How New Construction Standards Are Changing BTU Requirements

Building codes have dramatically reduced the BTU per square foot needed for new homes. The 2021 IECC (International Energy Conservation Code), now adopted in most states by 2026, requires:

| Code Requirement | Impact on BTU/sq ft |
|---|---|
| R-20 or R-13+5 wall insulation | −10–15% vs older homes |
| R-38 to R-60 attic insulation | −10–15% vs older homes |
| Air sealing (≤3 ACH50 blower door) | −15–20% vs older homes |
| Low-E double/triple-pane windows | −10–15% vs single pane |
| Insulated ductwork in conditioned space | −15–20% vs attic ducts |

A code-built 2026 home typically needs 30–40% less HVAC capacity than a comparable 1990s home. A 2,000 sq ft new-build in Zone 5 might only need 28,000–32,000 BTU for cooling (14–16 BTU/sq ft) compared to 40,000+ BTU for a 1990s home of the same size.

This is why "rule of thumb" sizing from older references tends to oversize modern homes. If your HVAC contractor quotes the same tonnage for your 2026 new-build as they'd quote for a 1990s home of the same size, get a second opinion or request a Manual J calculation.

## Special Cases and Exceptions

### Homes with Radiant Floor Heating

Radiant floor systems operate at lower BTU per square foot (15–30 BTU/sq ft in most climates) because they heat from the floor up, creating a more even temperature profile. The lower supply temperature (90–130°F vs 120–170°F for forced air) means less heat loss through ducts and more usable heat per BTU.

### Homes with Ductless Mini Splits

Mini splits eliminate duct losses (15–25% in many homes), effectively reducing the required BTU per square foot by that same percentage. A home that needs 20 BTU/sq ft with a ducted central system might only need 15–17 BTU/sq ft with ductless mini splits.

### Homes at High Altitude

At elevations above 4,000 feet, air density decreases, reducing the BTU output of gas furnaces and air conditioners by approximately 4% per 1,000 feet. A home at 6,000 feet (Denver) needs to derate equipment capacity by about 8%. In practice, this means you may need to select a slightly larger unit to compensate.

### Homes with Significant Internal Heat Gains

If your home has a server room, commercial kitchen, grow operation, or other major internal heat source, your cooling BTU per square foot for those areas can jump to 50–300 BTU/sq ft. These zones should be calculated separately from the rest of the home and may need dedicated cooling equipment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ>
  <FAQ.Item question="How many BTU per square foot do I need for cooling?">
    The standard baseline is 20 BTU per square foot for cooling, assuming average conditions. Hot climates (Phoenix, Houston, Miami) need 22–30 BTU/sq ft. Cool climates (Chicago, Boston, Denver) need 14–20 BTU/sq ft. Your insulation quality adjusts this by ±30%. Use 20 BTU/sq ft for a quick estimate, then apply your climate zone and insulation adjustments for a more accurate number.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How many BTU per square foot for heating?">
    Heating requirements range from 15–80 BTU per square foot depending on climate. Warm climates (Zone 2–3) need 15–35 BTU/sq ft. Mixed climates (Zone 4) need 30–45 BTU/sq ft. Cold climates (Zone 5–6) need 40–65 BTU/sq ft. Very cold climates (Zone 7) need 60–80 BTU/sq ft. These are furnace input BTU values — multiply by your furnace's AFUE to get output BTU.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is 20 BTU per square foot enough for cooling?">
    20 BTU/sq ft is enough for average homes in Climate Zones 4–5 (Nashville, Chicago) with standard insulation and 8-foot ceilings. It's not enough for hot climates (Zones 1–2), homes with poor insulation, upper floors, large windows, or high ceilings. In those cases, you may need 25–35 BTU/sq ft. It may be more than enough for well-insulated homes in cool climates, where 14–18 BTU/sq ft can suffice.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Why is my heating BTU per square foot higher than cooling?">
    The temperature difference is larger in winter. On a hot summer day, you might cool from 95°F to 75°F (20°F difference). On a cold winter night, you're heating from −5°F to 70°F (75°F difference). That 3–4× larger temperature gap requires 2–3× more BTU per square foot for heating. The exception is hot-humid climates (Zones 1–2), where cooling loads exceed heating loads.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do new homes need fewer BTU per square foot?">
    Yes, significantly. Modern building codes (2021 IECC, adopted in most jurisdictions by 2026) require better insulation, tighter air sealing, and higher-performance windows. A code-compliant 2026 home typically needs 30–40% fewer BTU per square foot than a comparable 1990s home. A passive house standard home can need up to 60% less. This is why using old rule-of-thumb sizing for new construction leads to oversized, inefficient HVAC systems.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How do I convert BTU per square foot to tons of AC?">
    Multiply your BTU per square foot by your total square footage, then divide by 12,000 (one ton = 12,000 BTU). For example: 20 BTU/sq ft × 2,000 sq ft = 40,000 BTU ÷ 12,000 = 3.33 tons, which rounds to a 3.5-ton system. Standard residential AC sizes come in 0.5-ton increments from 1.5 to 5 tons.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What BTU per square foot do I need for a garage?">
    For cooling an insulated garage: 25–35 BTU/sq ft (higher due to large door area, minimal insulation, and concrete slab heat gain). For heating: 35–55 BTU/sq ft depending on climate and insulation level. An uninsulated garage in a cold climate might need 60+ BTU/sq ft for heating. Insulating the garage door alone can reduce heating requirements by 20–30%.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Does ceiling height affect BTU per square foot?">
    Yes, significantly. The standard 20 BTU/sq ft assumes 8-foot ceilings. For 9-foot ceilings, add 12%. For 10-foot ceilings, add 25%. For 12-foot ceilings, add 50%. This is because you're heating or cooling a volume of air, not just a floor area. A 2,000 sq ft room with 10-foot ceilings has the same air volume as a 2,500 sq ft room with 8-foot ceilings.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How many BTU per square foot for a mini split?">
    Mini splits use the same BTU per square foot as any other cooling system — the room's cooling load doesn't change based on equipment type. However, because mini splits don't lose heat through ductwork, you can typically reduce the required capacity by 15–25% compared to a ducted system. So if a room needs 20 BTU/sq ft with central AC, it might only need 15–17 BTU/sq ft with a mini split.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Are BTU per square foot the same for every floor of a house?">
    No. The top floor needs 15–25% more cooling BTU per square foot than the ground floor because heat rises and the roof absorbs solar radiation. The ground floor over a slab or crawl space is relatively neutral. A basement typically needs 30–50% fewer cooling BTU per square foot because the surrounding earth keeps it naturally cool. For heating, the pattern reverses — basements lose less heat, but upper floors benefit from rising heat.
