# Carbon Monoxide Detector Placement: Where and How Many You Need

You need at minimum one carbon monoxide detector on every level of your home, plus one within 10 feet of each bedroom door — that's the requirement in virtually every US state with CO detector laws. For a typical 2-story, 3-bedroom home, this means 3–5 detectors: one on each floor level, one near the bedroom hallway, and ideally one near your furnace/water heater and attached garage entry.

Carbon monoxide is odorless, colorless, and kills approximately 420 Americans annually while sending another 100,000+ to emergency rooms. Correct detector placement is the difference between early warning at 30 ppm (mild headache territory) and discovery at 200+ ppm (life-threatening). This guide covers the exact placement rules from NFPA 720, building code requirements by state, mounting height, the best detectors for 2026, and the CO concentration levels you need to understand.

<TableOfContents />

## Carbon Monoxide: Why Placement Matters

Carbon monoxide (CO) is slightly lighter than air (molecular weight 28 vs. air's average of 29) but in practice mixes thoroughly with room air due to thermal convection. This means CO doesn't exclusively "rise" or "sink" — it distributes throughout a room. However, the warm air plume from combustion sources initially carries CO upward, which is why ceiling and high-wall mounting locations detect CO slightly faster than floor-level locations in many scenarios.

### CO Exposure Health Effects

| CO Level (ppm) | Duration | Symptoms | UL 2034 Alarm Response |
|----------------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| 0 | — | No CO present | — |
| 1–9 | Chronic | Normal indoor background; no symptoms | No alarm |
| 9–35 | 8 hours | EPA max 8-hour limit; possible mild headache in sensitive individuals | No alarm (below threshold) |
| 30 | 30 days | UL 2034 detectors must NOT alarm (to avoid nuisance alarms) | Must NOT alarm |
| 70 | 1–4 hours | Headache, fatigue, nausea | Must alarm within 60–240 minutes |
| 150 | 10–50 min | Severe headache, dizziness, confusion | Must alarm within 10–50 minutes |
| 400 | 4–15 min | Life-threatening within 1–2 hours | Must alarm within 4–15 minutes |
| 800+ | Minutes | Unconsciousness within 2 hours; death within 2–3 hours | Immediate alarm |

<Callout type="warning">
**CO detectors are NOT designed to detect low-level chronic exposure.** UL 2034 (the standard for residential CO detectors) requires detectors to NOT alarm below 30 ppm for 30 days. This means long-term low-level CO exposure (10–30 ppm) from a slightly malfunctioning furnace won't trigger a standard alarm, even though it can cause chronic headaches, fatigue, and cognitive issues. If you suspect low-level CO, use a dedicated low-level CO monitor (like the CO Experts 2022-LL or Defender CA6150) that alarms at 5–15 ppm.

## Where to Place CO Detectors: Room-by-Room Guide

### Required Locations (Code Minimum)

The International Residential Code (IRC 2021, Section R315) and NFPA 720 specify these minimum requirements:

1. **On every habitable level** of the dwelling (including basements)
2. **Outside each separate sleeping area** in the immediate vicinity of bedrooms (within 10 feet of bedroom doors)
3. **In every bedroom** (required by some state/local codes)

### Recommended Locations (Best Practice)

Beyond code minimums, add detectors in these high-risk locations:

| Location | Why | Priority |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Outside each bedroom group (hallway) | Code requirement; protects sleeping occupants | Required |
| Every floor level | Code requirement; catches CO migration between floors | Required |
| Within 10 feet of attached garage entry door | Vehicle exhaust is a leading CO source | High |
| Within 15 feet of furnace/boiler room | Furnace is the most common residential CO source | High |
| Near gas water heater | Second most common combustion CO source | High |
| In rooms with gas fireplaces | Direct combustion in living space | High |
| Basement (near mechanical equipment) | Furnace, water heater, and other gas appliances often here | High |
| Kitchen (10+ feet from gas stove) | Gas stove produces CO during normal use | Moderate |
| Inside each bedroom | Some codes require; best protection for sleeping occupants | Recommended |

### Placement Map for Common Home Layouts

**Single-Story, 3-Bedroom Home (Minimum 2–3 detectors):**
- One in the hallway between all bedrooms
- One near the furnace/water heater area
- One near the attached garage entry (if applicable)

**Two-Story, 3-Bedroom Home (Minimum 3–5 detectors):**
- One in the upstairs hallway near bedrooms
- One on the main floor (living area)
- One in the basement (near furnace/mechanical)
- One near the attached garage entry
- Optional: one in each bedroom

**Two-Story, 4-Bedroom Home with Basement (Minimum 4–6 detectors):**
- One in the upstairs hallway near bedrooms
- One in any bedroom on a different floor than the hallway detector
- One on the main floor (living area)
- One in the basement near mechanical equipment
- One near the attached garage entry
- Optional: one in each remaining bedroom

<Callout type="tip">
**The "10-foot rule" for bedrooms:** Place CO detectors within 10 feet of each bedroom door, measured along the ceiling path. In a long hallway with bedrooms at each end, you may need two detectors — one won't cover both ends if they're more than 20 feet apart. The goal is for every sleeping person to hear the alarm, so interconnected detectors (where one triggers all) provide the best protection.
</Callout>

## Mounting Height and Position

### Height Guidelines

| Mounting Location | Reasoning | Standard |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| Ceiling-mounted (preferred) | CO mixes with room air; ceiling provides widest audible range | NFPA 720 |
| High wall (within 12 inches of ceiling) | Nearly as effective as ceiling; easier installation | NFPA 720 |
| Any height (plug-in models at outlet height) | Acceptable per UL 2034; slightly slower detection than ceiling | UL 2034 |
| Near the floor | NOT recommended for CO (unlike natural gas, which is heavier) | — |

CO detectors perform well at any height because carbon monoxide mixes throughout a room. However, ceiling or high-wall placement provides two advantages: (1) the warm convective plume from combustion sources carries CO upward initially, and (2) the alarm sound carries farther from a ceiling position.

### Placement Don'ts

| Avoid Placing Detectors | Why |
|------------------------|-----|
| Within 5 feet of cooking appliances | Normal cooking produces brief CO spikes that cause nuisance alarms |
| In garages | Extreme temperature swings and vehicle exhaust cause constant false alarms; place just inside the house near the garage entry instead |
| In bathrooms | High humidity can damage sensors |
| Near windows, doors, or HVAC vents | Drafts dilute CO at the sensor, delaying detection |
| In dead air spaces (peak of vaulted ceiling, corners) | Stagnant air reduces circulation to sensor |
| Behind furniture or curtains | Blocks airflow to sensor |
| In direct sunlight | Heat affects sensor accuracy |
| Near paint, solvent, or cleaning product storage | Chemical fumes cause false alarms and sensor degradation |

## Building Code Requirements by State

As of 2026, 39 states plus Washington DC require CO detectors in residential buildings. Requirements vary significantly.

| State Group | Code Requirement | Applies To |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Strictest (CA, IL, MD, MA, NY, OR, WA)** | All residences; every bedroom + every level + near sleeping areas; hardwired + battery backup in new construction | All existing and new homes |
| **Standard (CO, CT, FL, GA, MN, NJ, PA, TX, VA, + 20 more)** | Every level + outside sleeping areas; new construction requires hardwired | New + existing homes with fossil fuel appliances or attached garages |
| **Minimal (some Southern and rural states)** | New construction only, or only with gas appliances | Limited scope |
| **No state requirement** | ~11 states have no statewide CO detector mandate | Local codes may still apply |

<Callout type="important">
Even if your state doesn't require CO detectors, you should install them if your home has: any gas appliances (furnace, water heater, stove, dryer, fireplace), an attached garage, a wood-burning fireplace or stove, or any oil-burning equipment. The cost is $20–$50 per detector. There is no rational reason to skip this.
</Callout>

## CO Detector Types: Which to Buy

### Sensor Technologies

| Technology | Accuracy | Lifespan | Price | Response Time | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Electrochemical | High (±5 ppm) | 5–10 years | $25–$80 | Fast (minutes) | Primary residential use |
| Biomimetic (gel) | Moderate (±15 ppm) | 2–5 years | $15–$30 | Slow (minutes–hours) | Budget temporary use |
| Metal oxide semiconductor | Moderate | 5–10 years | $20–$50 | Fast | Multi-gas detectors |

**Electrochemical sensors are the gold standard** for residential CO detection. They're used in professional-grade instruments and the best consumer detectors. Look for UL 2034 certification regardless of sensor type.

### Best CO Detectors for 2026

| Detector | Type | Power | Display | Smart Features | Low-Level Alert | Price | Our Rating |
|----------|------|-------|---------|---------------|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Kidde Nighthawk (KN-COPP-3) | Electrochemical | Plug-in + battery | Digital PPM | No | No (UL 2034 standard) | $30–$40 | ★★★★☆ |
| First Alert CO615 | Electrochemical | Plug-in + battery | Digital PPM | No | No | $25–$35 | ★★★★☆ |
| Google Nest Protect | Electrochemical + photoelectric smoke | Hardwired + battery | LED ring | Wi-Fi, app alerts, voice | No | $100–$120 | ★★★★★ |

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example: Low-Level CO Detection Saves a Family**
A family in suburban Ohio had been experiencing chronic fatigue, headaches, and difficulty concentrating for months. Standard CO detectors showed no alarm. After reading about low-level CO exposure, they purchased a CO Experts low-level monitor ($95). It immediately displayed 22 ppm — well below the UL 2034 alarm threshold of 70 ppm for 1–4 hours, but high enough to cause chronic symptoms. An HVAC technician found a cracked heat exchanger in their furnace, which was leaking combustion gases into the supply air. The furnace was 18 years old and had passed its last annual inspection only 6 months prior. The heat exchanger crack had developed since then.
</Callout>

### Standard vs. Low-Level CO Detectors

| Feature | Standard (UL 2034) | Low-Level Monitor |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Alarm threshold | 70 ppm (1–4 hrs) | 5–15 ppm (varies) |
| Designed for | Acute CO events | Chronic low-level exposure |
| False alarm rate | Low | Higher (cooking, traffic proximity) |
| Required by code | Yes (where codes apply) | No |
| Price | $20–$50 | $60–$120 |
| Best use | Primary protection for every home | Supplemental — add to homes with gas appliances |
| Recommended? | Essential | Highly recommended for homes with gas furnaces |

<Callout type="tip">
**Our recommendation:** Install standard UL 2034 CO detectors at every required location (code minimum). Then add one low-level CO monitor near your furnace room or the area where you spend the most time. The low-level monitor catches the insidious slow leaks that standard detectors are designed to ignore. Think of standard detectors as your fire alarm and low-level monitors as your smoke detector — both serve different but complementary purposes.

## Common CO Sources in Homes

Understanding where CO originates helps you place detectors strategically and identify problems early.

| Source | CO Risk Level | Typical CO Output (ppm) | Detection Priority |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Gas furnace (cracked heat exchanger) | Critical | 50–500+ in supply air | Highest — place detector near furnace AND in living space |
| Gas water heater (backdrafting) | High | 100–400 in room | High — detector near water heater |
| Vehicle in attached garage | High | 300–1,000+ in garage; 10–50 entering home | High — detector near garage entry door |
| Gas fireplace (venting failure) | High | 100–400 in room | High — detector in room with fireplace |
| Gas stove (normal operation) | Low–Moderate | 5–30 in kitchen during cooking | Moderate — cooking is normal; 30+ ppm sustained is a problem |
| Generator (portable, misused) | Extreme | 800–10,000+ | Life-threatening — never run indoors or in garage |
| Charcoal grill (indoor use) | Extreme | 1,000+ | Life-threatening — never use indoors |
| Wood-burning fireplace (poor draft) | Moderate | 20–100 in room | Moderate — detector in room |
| Blocked chimney/flue | High | 50–500 | High — annual inspection |

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example: The Backdrafting Water Heater**
A homeowner in Kansas City noticed her CO detector displaying 35 ppm (display showed the level but didn't alarm — below the 70 ppm threshold). She called her HVAC company, which found the natural-draft gas water heater was backdrafting — exhaust gases were flowing backward down the chimney into the house instead of venting outside. The cause: a new high-efficiency furnace had been installed 3 months earlier with a direct-vent PVC exhaust, but the old metal chimney now serving only the water heater had lost the warm furnace exhaust that previously maintained draft. The fix: a power-vented water heater replacement ($1,400). Without the digital display on her CO detector, the backdrafting would have continued undetected.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example: The Attached Garage Problem**
A family in Colorado noticed CO readings of 15–25 ppm on their detector near the garage entry door each morning. Investigation revealed the family member who left earliest was starting their car in the attached garage and letting it warm up for 3–5 minutes with the garage door closed before opening it. Even with the garage door opened afterward, residual CO migrated into the house through the shared wall. The solution: seal gaps around the garage-to-house door with weatherstripping ($15), and change the behavior to open the garage door before starting the vehicle and immediately driving out. CO readings dropped to 0 ppm.
</Callout>

## Maintenance and Replacement Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Test alarm button | Monthly | Verifies the horn and electronics work |
| Replace batteries | Annually (or when low-battery chirps) | 9V or AA batteries lose charge; sealed 10-year units don't need this |
| Vacuum/dust the unit | Every 6 months | Dust blocks sensor airflow |
| Replace entire unit | Every 5–7 years (or per manufacturer) | Electrochemical sensors degrade over time |
| Check digital display reading | Weekly (if equipped) | Catch low-level CO before alarm threshold |

**Sealed 10-year battery units** (like Kidde P3010K-CO or X-Sense SC08) simplify maintenance — no battery changes needed for a decade. Replace the entire unit when the sealed battery expires.

### How to Test Your CO Detector

Press and hold the Test button for 3–5 seconds. You should hear a loud alarm pattern (typically 4 beeps, pause, 4 beeps). This tests the electronics and alarm horn but does NOT test the sensor's ability to detect actual CO. Unfortunately, there's no consumer-grade method to test the sensor itself — which is why timely replacement (every 5–7 years) is critical.

## Interconnected vs. Standalone Detectors

| Feature | Standalone | Interconnected (Wired) | Interconnected (Wireless) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| One triggers all | No | Yes | Yes |
| Installation difficulty | Easy (DIY) | Professional (requires wiring) | Easy (DIY) |
| Required by code (new construction) | No | Yes (most jurisdictions) | Acceptable alternative |
| Cost per unit | $20–$50 | $30–$60 + wiring | $50–$130 |
| Best for | Existing homes (quick install) | New construction, renovation | Retrofit interconnection |
| Examples | Kidde KN-COPP-3, First Alert CO615 | Kidde KN-COSM-IBA | Google Nest Protect, Kidde Smart Detect |

<Callout type="important">
**Interconnection is the single most important feature after basic detection.** If your basement detector goes off at 3 AM, will you hear it from your second-floor bedroom? With standalone detectors, probably not. With interconnected detectors, the alarm in every room sounds simultaneously. Wireless interconnection (Google Nest Protect, Kidde Smart Detect) provides this without running new wiring in existing homes.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- Place CO detectors on every level, outside each sleeping area (within 10 feet of bedroom doors), and near gas appliances and attached garage entries
- Minimum for a typical 2-story, 3-bedroom home: 3–5 detectors
- Mount on ceiling or high wall (within 12 inches of ceiling); plug-in models at outlet height are acceptable
- Standard UL 2034 detectors don't alarm below 70 ppm — consider a low-level monitor (5–15 ppm alert) near your furnace for chronic leak detection
- Interconnected detectors (wired or wireless) ensure you hear alarms from every room — the most important feature after basic detection
- Replace CO detectors every 5–7 years — sensor degradation makes old units unreliable
- Test monthly by pressing the test button; vacuum dust every 6 months
- The top CO sources in homes: cracked furnace heat exchangers, backdrafting water heaters, and vehicle exhaust from attached garages
- A digital display showing PPM level is extremely valuable — it shows low-level CO that doesn't trigger the alarm
- If any detector shows elevated readings (even below alarm), call your HVAC company immediately and ventilate your home

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How many carbon monoxide detectors do I need?",
    answer: "At minimum, one on every habitable level (including basement) and one outside each separate sleeping area within 10 feet of bedroom doors. For a typical 2-story, 3-bedroom home, this means 3-4 as a code minimum. Best practice adds detectors near your furnace/water heater room and attached garage entry, bringing the total to 4-6. If bedrooms are on multiple floors, each group needs its own nearby detector."
  },
  {
    question: "Where is the best place to put a carbon monoxide detector?",
    answer: "The most critical location is the hallway outside bedrooms — this protects sleeping occupants who wouldn't smell or feel symptoms while asleep. Mount it on the ceiling or high wall within 12 inches of the ceiling. The second most important location is near your primary gas appliances (furnace, water heater), and the third is near any attached garage entry door. Keep detectors at least 5 feet from cooking appliances to avoid nuisance alarms."
  },
  {
    question: "Should CO detectors be high or low?",
    answer: "High. Mount CO detectors on the ceiling or on a wall within 12 inches of the ceiling. While CO mixes throughout a room and can be detected at any height, ceiling mounting provides faster detection (CO from combustion sources initially rises with warm air) and better audible alarm coverage. Plug-in models at outlet height are acceptable per UL 2034 standards, but high mounting is preferred when possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a carbon monoxide detector if I have all electric appliances?",
    answer: "If you have no gas appliances, no attached garage, no wood-burning fireplace, and no fuel-burning equipment of any kind, the CO risk is minimal and many codes exempt all-electric homes. However, detectors are still recommended because CO can enter from external sources (neighbor's generator during a power outage, vehicle exhaust from outside), and home modifications may introduce combustion sources in the future. At $25-40 per detector, the insurance is worth it."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should carbon monoxide detectors be replaced?",
    answer: "Replace CO detectors every 5-7 years, or per the manufacturer's stated lifespan (printed on the unit). Electrochemical sensors degrade over time and lose sensitivity — a 10-year-old detector may not respond to CO at all. Sealed 10-year battery models should be replaced at the 10-year mark when the battery expires. Check the manufacture date on the back of your current detectors; if there's no date or it's older than 7 years, replace immediately."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a CO detector and a CO monitor?",
    answer: "A standard CO detector (UL 2034) is designed to alarm at dangerous acute exposure levels — 70 ppm for 1-4 hours, 150 ppm for 10-50 minutes, 400 ppm for 4-15 minutes. It will NOT alarm at chronic low levels (below 30 ppm). A low-level CO monitor alerts at 5-15 ppm, catching the slow leaks that cause chronic symptoms like headaches and fatigue. For comprehensive protection, use standard detectors at all required locations plus one low-level monitor near your furnace."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my CO detector keep beeping?",
    answer: "A single chirp every 30-60 seconds indicates low battery — replace the battery immediately. A pattern of 4 beeps, pause, 4 beeps is the actual CO alarm — evacuate immediately, call 911, and do not re-enter until cleared by emergency services. A constant beep may indicate end-of-life — check the manufacture date and replace if older than 5-7 years. Three beeps may indicate a malfunction — replace the unit. Check your specific model's manual, as beep patterns vary by manufacturer."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I put a CO detector in the kitchen?",
    answer: "Yes, but place it at least 10-15 feet from gas cooking appliances. Gas stoves produce 5-30 ppm CO during normal cooking, which can trigger nuisance alarms if the detector is too close. A kitchen detector is valuable for catching gas stove malfunctions (burner not igniting properly, blocked vent hood) and general kitchen CO issues. Position it on the wall or ceiling of the kitchen away from the stove area, or in the adjacent hallway."
  },
  {
    question: "Do CO detectors detect natural gas leaks?",
    answer: "No. Standard CO detectors detect only carbon monoxide. Natural gas (methane) requires a separate combustible gas detector. Some combination units detect both CO and natural gas/propane — these are marked as 'CO and combustible gas' detectors and typically cost $40-80. If you want both capabilities, buy a combo unit or install separate CO and gas detectors. Note that the rotten-egg smell in natural gas (mercaptan additive) serves as a built-in 'detector' for gas leaks."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if my CO detector goes off?",
    answer: "1) Do not ignore it — take every alarm seriously. 2) Evacuate all people and pets immediately. 3) Call 911 from outside the home. 4) Do not re-enter until emergency services clear the home. 5) If anyone shows CO poisoning symptoms (headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion), inform the paramedics immediately. The fire department will use professional CO detection equipment to identify the source and concentration. After clearance, have an HVAC technician inspect all combustion appliances before using them again."
