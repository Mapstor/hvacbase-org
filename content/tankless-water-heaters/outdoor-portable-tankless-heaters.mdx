## Detailed Reviews

### #1: Eccotemp L10 — Best Overall Portable

The L10 delivers 2.65 GPM and 74,500 BTU — a genuine hot shower experience. The battery-powered ignition uses two D-cells that last for months. It connects to 1-pound propane canisters or 20-pound tanks with an adapter hose.

The built-in carrying handle and 18-pound weight make it genuinely portable. Ideal for car camping, base camps, hunting cabins, and RVs.

**Water pressure note:** The L10 needs about 20 PSI minimum. For gravity-fed sources, add a 12V portable pump ($25–$50).

**Real-world example:** A couple car camping uses the L10 with a 5-gallon water bladder and 12V pump. Two hot showers per day, one 1-pound canister lasts 2–3 showers. Weekend propane cost: about $6.

### #2: Fogatti InstaShower 8 — Best for RV

The InstaShower 8 is designed for RV integration with CSA-certified LP connection and anti-freeze protection. At 2.9 GPM and 80,000 BTU, it outperforms any RV tank heater. Fits standard RV water heater compartments.

**Real-world example:** A Class C owner replaced a corroded 6-gallon tank with the InstaShower 8. Installation took 3 hours. Unlimited hot showers instead of rationing.

### #3: Camplux AY132GP — Most Portable

At 9.5 pounds and 1.32 GPM, this is the lightest tankless with enough output for a basic shower. Compact enough for motorcycle camping and kayak trips.

**Temperature limitation:** At 34,000 BTU with cold input water, output reaches only 92F in winter — a summer camping unit.

### #4–#6: Budget and Mid-Range Options

**Eccotemp CEL10 ($200–$260):** Updated L10 with digital temperature display and slightly lighter weight.

**Camp Chef HWD5 ($130–$180):** Reliable mid-range from a trusted brand. 1.5 GPM for warm showers.

**Gasland BE158S ($130–$170):** Good value at 1.58 GPM with safety features. Only 11 lbs.

## Propane Usage for Portable Units

<ComparisonTable
  title="Propane Consumption: Portable Tankless Models"
  headers={["Model", "BTU/h", "Propane per Hour", "Runtime on 1-lb Canister", "Runtime on 20-lb Tank"]}
  rows={[
    ["Camplux AY132GP", "34,000", "0.37 gal/hr", "About 1 hour", "About 54 hours"],
    ["Camp Chef HWD5", "52,000", "0.57 gal/hr", "About 40 min", "About 35 hours"],

    ["Fogatti InstaShower 8", "80,000", "0.87 gal/hr", "About 26 min", "About 23 hours"],

/>

**Cost comparison:** 1-pound canister ($3–$5) provides 2–4 showers at $1.00–$2.50 each. 20-pound tank refill ($15–$25) provides 40–90 showers at $0.15–$0.40 each.

<Callout type="tip">
**Get a 20-pound adapter hose ($15–$25).** The cost savings from a 20-pound tank versus 1-pound canisters pays for the adapter in 3–5 refills.
</Callout>

## Water Source Options

**RV city water hookup:** Direct connection at 40–60 PSI.

**Garden hose:** Direct connection at 30–50 PSI.

**12V portable pump:** Draws from a collapsible container, provides 40–60 PSI. Powers from vehicle 12V outlet or portable battery.

**Gravity feed:** Requires 10+ feet elevation for adequate pressure. Most units need 20+ PSI, so gravity feed alone often fails.

## Safety Considerations

**Carbon monoxide:** Never use indoors, in tents, or in enclosed spaces. Outdoor use only with natural ventilation.

**Propane safety:** Check connections for leaks using soapy water. Store canisters upright, away from heat.

**Water temperature:** Test with your hand before showering. Some units produce over 130F at low flow rates.

**Freeze protection:** Drain completely after use in cold weather to prevent cracked tubing.

## Real-World Setup Examples

### Example 1: Car Camping

**Gear:** Eccotemp L10, 5-gallon collapsible jug, 12V EccoFlo pump, shower tent, 20-lb propane tank.

**Setup time:** 10 minutes. Hot shower cost: about $0.40.

### Example 2: RV Full-Time Living

**Gear:** Fogatti InstaShower 8, permanently installed, connected to RV LP system.

**Result:** Unlimited hot water. Monthly propane for water heating: 8–12 gallons ($22–$34).

### Example 3: Emergency Home Use

**Gear:** Eccotemp L10, garden hose, 20-lb tank from grill.

**Result:** Hot water during 3-day power outage. Battery ignition means zero electricity needed.

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What is the best portable tankless water heater for camping?",
    answer: "The Eccotemp L10 is the best overall choice: 2.65 GPM, 18 pounds, battery-powered ignition, compatible with 1-pound canisters and 20-pound tanks, priced at $170–$220. For ultralight camping, the Camplux AY132GP at 9.5 pounds delivers lower flow at 1.32 GPM."
  },
  {
    question: "How much propane does a portable tankless water heater use?",
    answer: "A mid-size unit (50,000–75,000 BTU) uses 0.5–0.8 gallons of propane per hour of active use. An 8-minute shower consumes about 0.07–0.11 gallons. A 1-pound canister lasts 2–4 showers. A 20-pound tank lasts 40–90 showers."
  },
  {
    question: "Do portable tankless water heaters need electricity?",
    answer: "No. Portable models use battery-powered ignition (typically 2–4 D-cell batteries) that lasts for months. No electrical outlet, generator, or solar panel needed. This makes them ideal for off-grid and emergency use."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a portable tankless water heater indoors?",
    answer: "Absolutely not. Portable propane tankless heaters produce carbon monoxide and must be used outdoors only. Indoor use creates a lethal CO poisoning risk and voids the warranty."
  },
  {
    question: "What water pressure do portable tankless heaters need?",
    answer: "Most require 20–25 PSI minimum. City water, RV hookups, and garden hoses provide adequate pressure. For unpressurized sources, add a 12V diaphragm pump ($25–$60)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I replace my RV tank water heater with a tankless?",
    answer: "Yes. Units like the Fogatti InstaShower 8 are designed as direct RV replacements. They fit standard compartments, connect to the RV LP system, and provide unlimited hot water instead of 6–10 gallon tank capacity."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a hot shower last with a portable tankless heater?",
    answer: "With a 20-pound propane tank, you get 20–90 hours of hot water depending on BTU output. The water supply is typically the limiting factor. A 5-gallon container provides about 2 showers at 2.5 GPM."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the lightest portable tankless water heater?",
    answer: "The Camplux AY132GP at 9.5 pounds is the lightest with usable shower output. The Gasland BE158S at 11 pounds offers slightly higher flow. Both fit easily in a backpack or small gear bag."
