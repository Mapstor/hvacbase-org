# How Much Propane Does a Tankless Water Heater Use? (Gallons + Cost)

A propane tankless water heater uses **0.8–2.5 gallons of propane per day** for a typical family, costing **$2.20–$7.50 per day** at the 2026 national average of $2.80 per gallon. That translates to **200–500 gallons per year** and **$560–$1,400 annually**, depending on household size, groundwater temperature, and unit efficiency.

The good news: a propane tankless uses 15–30% less propane than a standard propane tank heater because it eliminates standby losses and operates at higher efficiency (0.93 UEF vs 0.58–0.67 UEF for tank models).

<TableOfContents />

## The Propane Usage Formula

Propane contains 91,500 BTU per gallon. A tankless water heater's propane consumption follows this formula:

**Gallons per day = (GPM x Minutes of use x Temperature rise x 500) / (91,500 x UEF)**

Where GPM is the average flow rate during use, minutes of use is total daily hot water runtime, temperature rise is desired temp minus incoming groundwater, 500 is the constant (BTU to heat 1 gallon of water 1F per hour), and UEF is the unit's efficiency rating.

### Simplified Version

For practical estimation:

**Gallons per day = Daily hot water gallons x Temperature rise / (91,500 x UEF)**

A family of 4 using 60 gallons of hot water per day with a 65F temperature rise and a 0.93 UEF condensing unit:

60 x 65 x 8.33 / (91,500 x 0.93) = 60 x 65 / (91,500 x 0.93 / 8.33) = **approximately 1.27 gallons per day** or **38 gallons per month**.

At $2.80/gallon: **$3.56/day, $107/month, $1,283/year.**

## Monthly and Annual Cost by Propane Price

Propane prices vary dramatically by region and season. Here is what a family of 4 (65 gallons/day, moderate climate) pays at different propane prices:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Monthly Propane Cost for Tankless (Family of 4, 65F Rise)"
  headers={["Propane Price (per gallon)", "Monthly Usage", "Monthly Cost", "Annual Cost"]}
  rows={[
    ["$1.80 (bulk contract, low)", "41 gal", "$74", "$886"],
    ["$2.20 (low region)", "41 gal", "$90", "$1,083"],
    ["$2.80 (national average)", "41 gal", "$115", "$1,377"],
    ["$3.20 (moderate region)", "41 gal", "$131", "$1,574"],
    ["$3.80 (high region/winter peak)", "41 gal", "$156", "$1,869"],
    ["$4.50 (extreme/emergency delivery)", "41 gal", "$185", "$2,214"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
**Propane price seasonality:** Prices can swing 40–60% between summer lows and winter peaks. Lock in a pre-buy or fixed-rate contract in late summer (July–September) to avoid winter price spikes. A 500-gallon pre-buy in August at $2.20/gallon versus emergency delivery in January at $4.00/gallon saves $900 on the same 500 gallons.

## Propane Tankless vs Propane Tank: Usage Comparison

<ComparisonTable
  title="Annual Propane Usage: Tankless vs Tank (Family of 4)"
  headers={["Metric", "Propane Tank (50 gal, 0.60 UEF)", "Propane Tankless (Condensing, 0.93 UEF)", "Savings"]}
  rows={[
    ["Annual propane for heating water", "480–550 gallons", "330–400 gallons", "130–170 gallons (28–31%)"],
    ["Propane wasted on standby", "80–120 gallons", "0 gallons", "80–120 gallons (100%)"],
    ["Total annual propane", "560–670 gallons", "330–400 gallons", "210–290 gallons saved"],
    ["Annual cost at $2.80/gal", "$1,568–$1,876", "$924–$1,120", "$530–$870 saved"],
  ]}
/>

**Propane users see the biggest savings from going tankless** because propane is expensive and standby losses on tank heaters waste 80–120 gallons per year — that is $225–$335 in pure waste at $2.80/gallon.

The payback on a propane tankless is often faster than for natural gas. A $2,000 premium over a propane tank, with $530–$870 in annual savings, pays back in **2.3–3.8 years**.

## Propane Tank Sizing for Tankless Heaters

Your propane storage tank must deliver adequate vaporization pressure to feed the tankless heater at full fire. This is critical — an undersized propane tank is the #1 cause of "my tankless keeps shutting off" complaints in propane homes.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Propane Tank Sizing Requirements"
  headers={["Tankless BTU Rating", "Min Tank Size (Cold Climate)", "Min Tank Size (Warm Climate)", "Annual Refills Needed"]}
  rows={[
    ["100,000 BTU/h", "250 gallon", "120 gallon", "2–3 per year"],
    ["120,000 BTU/h", "250 gallon", "250 gallon", "2–3 per year"],
    ["150,000 BTU/h", "500 gallon", "250 gallon", "3–4 per year"],
    ["199,900 BTU/h", "500 gallon", "500 gallon", "3–5 per year"],
    ["Two units in parallel", "1,000 gallon", "500 gallon", "5–8 per year"],
  ]}
/>

**Why cold climate matters for tank sizing:** Propane vaporizes (converts from liquid to gas) more slowly in cold temperatures. A 250-gallon tank at 20F ambient can only deliver about 175,000 BTU/h of vaporized gas. At 0F, that drops to roughly 130,000 BTU/h. If your tankless needs 199,000 BTU/h, the 250-gallon tank cannot keep up in winter, even if it is full.

<Callout type="important">
**Rule of thumb:** In cold climates (winter ambient below 20F), your propane tank should be rated for at least 150% of your tankless unit's BTU/h demand. For a 199,000 BTU/h unit, that means a 500-gallon tank minimum. Consult your propane supplier for a vaporization analysis specific to your location.

## Reducing Propane Consumption

### 1. Choose a Condensing Unit

The efficiency gap between condensing (0.93 UEF) and non-condensing (0.82 UEF) is even more significant with propane. At $2.80/gallon, upgrading from non-condensing to condensing saves $130–$200/year — paying for the condensing premium in 2–4 years.

### 2. Lower Your Set Temperature

Reducing from 120F to 115F cuts propane usage by approximately 7%. For a family of 4, that is 25–35 gallons/year saved ($70–$100).

### 3. Install Low-Flow Fixtures

A 1.5 GPM showerhead instead of 2.0 GPM reduces hot water usage (and propane) by 25% per shower. Annual savings: 50–80 gallons ($140–$225).

### 4. Insulate Hot Water Pipes

Foam pipe insulation on the first 6 feet of hot and cold water pipe from the heater reduces heat loss in transit, meaning you run the faucet for less time before hot water arrives. Annual savings: 10–20 gallons.

### 5. Fix Leaks Immediately

A dripping hot water faucet wastes 1,660 gallons of hot water per year — approximately 8 gallons of propane per year ($22). A running toilet with a stuck hot valve wastes far more.

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How many gallons of propane does a tankless water heater use per month?",
    answer: "A propane tankless water heater uses 25–50 gallons per month for a typical family, depending on household size and climate. A family of 4 in a moderate climate uses about 38–42 gallons/month. In cold climates with higher temperature rise, usage increases to 45–55 gallons/month. In warm climates, expect 28–35 gallons/month."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a propane tankless water heater worth it?",
    answer: "Yes — propane users see the strongest financial case for tankless because propane is expensive ($2.50–$3.80/gallon). A condensing tankless saves 130–290 gallons per year ($365–$810), with a typical payback of 2–4 years on the installation premium. This is faster than natural gas tankless payback (5–10 years) because the fuel cost savings are proportionally larger."
  },
  {
    question: "How often will I need to refill my propane tank with a tankless heater?",
    answer: "For water heating only (not counting furnace or other propane appliances), a family of 4 uses 330–500 gallons/year. With a 500-gallon tank, that is 1–2 dedicated water heating refills per year. However, most homes use propane for multiple purposes (heating, cooking, dryer), so you are likely already on a regular delivery schedule that absorbs the water heater's usage."
  },
  {
    question: "What size propane tank do I need for a tankless water heater?",
    answer: "A 500-gallon tank is recommended for tankless units rated at 150,000 BTU/h or higher, especially in cold climates. A 250-gallon tank can work for units under 150,000 BTU/h in warm climates. The critical factor is vaporization rate, not just storage volume — cold temperatures reduce the rate at which liquid propane becomes gas, potentially starving the heater."
  },
  {
    question: "Is propane tankless cheaper than electric tankless?",
    answer: "It depends on local rates. At $2.80/gallon propane and $0.167/kWh electricity, a propane condensing tankless costs roughly $1,100–$1,400/year while electric costs $600–$900/year for the same family. Electric is cheaper to operate in most cases. However, propane tankless delivers 2–3x more flow rate, making it necessary for whole-home use in cold climates where electric cannot keep up."
  },
  {
    question: "How much propane does a tankless water heater use per hour?",
    answer: "At full fire (199,900 BTU/h), a tankless water heater uses about 2.18 gallons of propane per hour. At typical modulated operation (60–70% of capacity), usage is 1.3–1.5 gallons per hour. However, the unit only fires when a faucet is open — the average home uses the unit for 20–60 minutes per day, not continuously."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a propane tankless water heater use a pilot light?",
    answer: "No. Modern propane tankless water heaters use electronic ignition (either direct spark or hot surface ignition), eliminating the standing pilot light that older tank models used. This saves 5–10 gallons of propane per month that a standing pilot would consume. The unit draws only 3–5 watts of electricity for standby controls."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I run a propane tankless water heater off a 100-pound cylinder?",
    answer: "Only for very small units (under 60,000 BTU/h) in warm weather. A 100-pound (approximately 24-gallon) cylinder can deliver about 45,000 BTU/h of vaporized gas at 60F ambient. Most residential tankless units need 120,000–199,000 BTU/h. For temporary or emergency use, you could connect two 100-pound cylinders in parallel, but this is not a long-term solution."
