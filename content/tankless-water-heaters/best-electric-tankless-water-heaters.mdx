# Best Electric Tankless Water Heaters in 2026 (240V, 50–150A)

The best electric tankless water heater for whole-home use in 2026 is the **EcoSmart ECO 36** — 36 kW of heating power, a 0.99 UEF, and up to 6.1 GPM at 35°F rise, for $550–$700. For point-of-use, the **EcoSmart ECO 11** delivers 2.2 GPM on a single 60A circuit for under $300.

Electric tankless heaters convert nearly 100% of input energy to hot water (0.96–0.99 UEF), require no venting, produce zero combustion emissions, and cost 40–70% less to install than gas. The trade-off is lower flow capacity — the largest residential electric unit tops out at 36 kW (122,800 BTU/h equivalent), versus 199,900 BTU/h for gas.

<TableOfContents />

## Understanding Electric Tankless Specs

Before comparing models, you need to understand three electrical specifications that determine whether an electric tankless heater will work in your home:

### Power Rating (kW)

This is the heating capacity. More kW = more hot water. Residential units range from 3.5 kW (a single-sink unit) to 36 kW (whole-home in warm climates). The relationship between kW, flow rate, and temperature rise follows a simple formula:

**GPM = kW × 5.86 ÷ Temperature Rise**

At 36 kW with a 50°F rise: 36 × 5.86 ÷ 50 = **4.2 GPM** (two fixtures comfortably).
At 36 kW with a 77°F rise: 36 × 5.86 ÷ 77 = **2.7 GPM** (one shower, maybe).

### Amperage Draw

This is what determines whether your electrical panel can support the unit. Formula:

**Amps = kW × 1,000 ÷ Voltage**

A 36 kW unit at 240V draws: 36,000 ÷ 240 = **150 amps**. That's 75% of a 200A panel's total capacity. Most 36 kW units split this across multiple circuits — typically four 40A breakers.

### Circuit Configuration

Electric tankless units use multiple parallel heating elements, each on its own circuit. Here's how the most common configurations break down:

<ComparisonTable

    ["36 kW", "150A", "4× 40A breakers", "#8 AWG each", "200A+ required"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
**Panel reality check:** A 200A panel has 200A total capacity, shared among ALL circuits — HVAC, range, dryer, lighting, etc. A typical home's existing load is 80–120A. Adding a 27 kW tankless (113A) to a home using 100A leaves only 87A of margin — which is tight. Have an electrician perform a load calculation (NEC Article 220) before committing to a whole-home electric tankless.

## Detailed Reviews

### #1: EcoSmart ECO 36 — Best Overall Electric

The ECO 36 has dominated the electric tankless category for years, and for good reason. At 36 kW with a 0.99 UEF, it extracts maximum heat from every kilowatt. The self-modulating technology adjusts power draw in real time — heating a single sink uses only 5–8 kW, not the full 36.

The digital temperature control adjusts in 1°F increments from 80–140°F. The compact enclosure (17" × 17" × 3.75") fits in a closet, under a sink, or on a utility room wall. The patented copper and stainless steel components resist corrosion.

EcoSmart's lifetime warranty on the heat exchanger (for the original owner) is the longest in the electric category. Replacement heating elements are $30–$50 each and take 15 minutes to swap.

**Key limitation:** At 36 kW, you need 150A of available panel capacity. If your panel is maxed, budget $1,500–$3,000 for a panel upgrade.

**Ideal climate range:** Groundwater above 57°F for whole-home 2-fixture use. Below 57°F, it becomes a 1-fixture unit.

**Real-world example:** A couple in Tampa, FL (groundwater 72°F, 48°F rise needed) installed the ECO 36 in their 1,800 sq ft home. It delivers 4.4 GPM at 48°F rise — running two showers simultaneously with no temperature drop. Existing 200A panel had 80A of headroom. Installation cost: $1,400 total. Monthly electric increase: $18. Monthly savings vs old 50-gallon tank: $24. Net savings: $6/month, plus they reclaimed closet space.

### #2: Stiebel Eltron Tempra 36 Plus — Best Premium Electric

The Tempra 36 Plus shares the ECO 36's 36 kW / 0.99 UEF specs but adds one killer feature: **Advanced Flow Control (AFC)**. When demand exceeds the unit's heating capacity, AFC automatically reduces flow rate to maintain temperature, rather than delivering lukewarm water. You get warm water at lower pressure instead of cold water at full pressure.

The temperature display is accurate to 1°F, and the control knob provides smooth analog adjustment. Copper heating chambers and brass fittings signal the German engineering pedigree. The 7-year parts warranty is shorter than EcoSmart's lifetime but backed by Stiebel Eltron's excellent customer support.

**Best for:** Homeowners who want temperature consistency above all else, even if it means temporarily reduced flow.

**Real-world example:** A family of 3 in Sacramento, CA (groundwater 60°F, 60°F rise) relies on the Tempra 36 for their 3-bathroom home. During peak demand (two showers + dishwasher), AFC briefly reduces shower flow from 2.0 to 1.6 GPM — barely noticeable. Without AFC, the temperature would have dropped 5–8°F.

### #3: Rheem RTEX-36 — Best Value Whole-Home

Rheem's RTEX-36 matches the ECO 36 and Tempra 36 on specs but costs $50–$200 less. The digital temperature display, self-modulating technology, and 36 kW heating capacity are all present. The main trade-off is warranty: Rheem's 5-year limited warranty on the heat exchanger is significantly shorter than EcoSmart's lifetime coverage.

Available at Home Depot and through every major plumbing supply house, parts are never hard to find. The unit shares the same 17" × 17" × 3.75" footprint as competitors.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious whole-home electric installs where warranty length isn't the top priority.

### #4: EcoSmart ECO 27 — Best Mid-Range

At 27 kW and $400–$550, the ECO 27 hits a sweet spot for smaller homes and warm climates. It draws 113A at 240V across three 40A circuits — a more manageable panel load than the 36 kW units.

At a 35°F rise, it delivers 4.6 GPM (two full showers). At a 50°F rise, it delivers 3.2 GPM (one shower plus a faucet). This is the right unit when you need more than point-of-use but don't need 36 kW of whole-home power.

**Best for:** 1–2 bathroom homes in warm climates, homes with 150A panels, or as a dedicated unit for a large master bathroom.

### #5: Stiebel Eltron Tempra 29 Plus — Best Flow Control Mid-Range

The Tempra 29 Plus (29 kW) includes Stiebel Eltron's Advanced Flow Control at a lower power level. Delivers 4.9 GPM at 35°F rise, and the AFC feature ensures consistent temperature even when two fixtures run simultaneously.

At $600–$800, it's the premium option in the mid-range category. The three 50A circuits need #6 AWG wire — slightly more expensive than the #8 AWG used by 40A circuit configurations.

### #6: Rheem RTEX-24 — Best Budget Whole-Home

At 24 kW and $400–$550, the RTEX-24 is the cheapest path to whole-home electric tankless. It delivers 4.1 GPM at 35°F rise — enough for a single shower plus a faucet in moderate climates. Three 40A circuits at 240V draw 100A total.

This unit works best in warm climates (Southeast, Southwest, coastal) where groundwater temperatures above 65°F keep the required temperature rise manageable.

### #7: EcoSmart ECO 11 — Best Point-of-Use

The ECO 11 punches above its weight at 13 kW. A single 60A circuit delivers 2.2 GPM at 35°F rise — enough for a full shower in warm climates or a bathroom sink and handwashing in cold climates.

At $200–$300 and 11.5" × 8" × 3.75", it's the go-to for guest bathrooms, home offices, pool houses, garages, and any space where running hot water pipes from the main heater is impractical. Installation takes 2–3 hours for a licensed electrician.

### #8–#10: Compact Point-of-Use Models

**Stiebel Eltron Tempra 12 Plus ($350–$450):** Premium build quality for single-fixture use. AFC technology prevents cold surprises. 12 kW on a single 50A circuit. Best for kitchens and bathrooms where consistent temperature matters.

**Rheem RTEX-08 ($180–$250):** Ultra-compact 8 kW unit on a single 40A circuit. Delivers 1.4 GPM at 35°F rise — perfect for a handwashing sink or utility sink. The cheapest name-brand electric tankless.

**Bosch Tronic 3000T ($200–$280):** Bosch's reliable point-of-use model at 7.2 kW. Compact design mounts in tight spaces. Best for commercial handwashing stations and restroom sinks.

<Callout type="tip">
**Point-of-use strategy:** Instead of one large whole-home unit, consider multiple point-of-use units at each fixture group. Two ECO 11 units ($600 total) on separate circuits can serve two bathrooms independently, with simpler wiring and no central failure point.

## Climate-Based Sizing Guide

Electric tankless performance is entirely climate-dependent. Here's a realistic sizing chart based on groundwater temperature:

  headers={["Climate / Groundwater Temp", "For 1 Shower (2.0 GPM)", "For 2 Showers (4.0 GPM)", "For Whole Home (5.5 GPM)"]}
  rows={[
    ["South FL, HI (75°F+)", "ECO 11 (13 kW)", "ECO 24 (24 kW)", "ECO 27 (27 kW)"],
    ["Southeast, SW (65–74°F)", "ECO 11 (13 kW)", "ECO 27 (27 kW)", "ECO 36 (36 kW)"],
    ["Mid-Atlantic, Pacific (55–64°F)", "RTEX-18 (18 kW)", "ECO 36 (36 kW)", "Not feasible (single unit)"],
    ["Midwest, NE (45–54°F)", "ECO 24 (24 kW)", "Not feasible (single unit)", "Not feasible"],
    ["Northern, Mountain (37–44°F)", "ECO 27+ (27 kW)", "Not feasible (single unit)", "Not feasible"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
**Cold-climate reality:** In northern states with groundwater below 50°F, electric tankless can only serve 1 fixture at a time — even with a 36 kW unit. For whole-home hot water in cold climates, you need gas tankless, a heat pump water heater, or multiple electric tankless units in parallel.
</Callout>

## Electrical Panel Assessment

Before buying an electric tankless, answer these three questions:

### 1. What's Your Panel Rating?

Check the main breaker at the top of your electrical panel. Common ratings: 100A, 125A, 150A, 200A, or 400A. A whole-home electric tankless (27–36 kW) practically requires a 200A panel.

### 2. What's Your Available Capacity?

Your existing loads (HVAC, range, dryer, EV charger, etc.) consume a portion of your panel's capacity. An electrician can perform a load calculation per NEC Article 220 to determine available amperage. If your total load exceeds 80% of panel capacity, you need an upgrade.

### 3. Do You Have Space for New Breakers?

A 36 kW unit needs four double-pole 40A breaker slots — that's 8 slots total. Many older panels are full or have only 2–4 open slots. A sub-panel ($300–$600) or main panel upgrade ($1,500–$3,000) may be needed.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Southern California Condo

**Setup:** 1,200 sq ft, 2 bathrooms, couple. Groundwater: 62°F. 200A panel with 90A available.

**Unit:** EcoSmart ECO 27 (27 kW, 113A draw across 3 circuits). Delivers 3.9 GPM at 58°F rise — two showers simultaneously, just barely.

**Install cost:** $1,650 (unit $480, electrician $700, materials $350, permit $120).

**Operating cost:** ~$22/month, down from $35/month with old 40-gallon tank. Annual savings: $156.

### Example 2: Florida Vacation Home

**Setup:** 1,600 sq ft beach house, 2 bathrooms, used seasonally. Groundwater: 74°F. 200A panel.

**Unit:** EcoSmart ECO 24 (24 kW). Delivers 4.5 GPM at 46°F rise — more than enough.

**Install cost:** $1,200 (unit $430, electrician $500, materials $200, permit $70).

**Result:** Zero standby losses when the house sits empty — the old tank wasted $15/month keeping water hot 24/7 in an empty house. Annual savings: $240+ including eliminated standby waste.

### Example 3: Point-of-Use for Home Office

**Setup:** Home office with a half-bath 40 feet from the main water heater. Hot water took 30+ seconds to arrive.

**Unit:** Rheem RTEX-08 (8 kW) installed under the sink.

**Install cost:** $520 (unit $200, electrician $250, materials $70). Single 40A circuit.

**Result:** Instant hot water at the sink. The 1.4 GPM capacity is more than enough for handwashing. No more running the faucet for 30 seconds waiting for hot water.

### Example 4: Multi-Unit Strategy in North Carolina

**Setup:** 2,400 sq ft home, 3 bathrooms. Groundwater: 55°F. 200A panel fully utilized (HVAC, EV charger).

**Solution:** Instead of one 36 kW unit (impossible — no panel capacity), installed three EcoSmart ECO 11 units (13 kW each, 39 kW total) — one per bathroom. Each runs on its own 60A circuit. Staggered demand means the actual simultaneous draw rarely exceeds 26 kW.

**Install cost:** $2,800 total. No panel upgrade needed because loads are distributed.

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What size electric tankless water heater do I need?",
    answer: "Size depends on your peak simultaneous GPM demand and your groundwater temperature. In warm climates (groundwater 65°F+), a 27 kW unit handles a 2-bathroom home. In moderate climates (55–64°F), you need 36 kW for 2 fixtures. In cold climates (below 55°F), a single electric unit can only reliably serve 1 fixture — consider gas or multiple electric units."
  },
  {
    question: "Do electric tankless water heaters need 220V or 240V?",
    answer: "Residential electric tankless heaters run on 240V (the standard voltage at your electrical panel). The terms '220V' and '240V' are often used interchangeably — they refer to the same circuit. Single-phase 240V is standard. Three-phase 208V is used in some commercial applications and reduces output by about 15%."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I install an electric tankless water heater with a 100A panel?",
    answer: "Only for small point-of-use units (8–13 kW, drawing 33–54A). Whole-home electric tankless (24–36 kW) draw 100–150A and require a 200A panel minimum. With a 100A panel, your best options are a panel upgrade ($1,500–$3,000), a gas tankless, or a point-of-use electric unit at a single fixture."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does an electric tankless water heater cost to run per month?",
    answer: "Monthly operating cost depends on usage, water temperature, and electricity rate. A family of 3 using 50 gallons/day in a warm climate (50°F rise) with electricity at $0.13/kWh pays roughly $25–$35/month. In a cold climate (80°F rise), the same usage costs $40–$55/month. Compare this to a 50-gallon electric tank at $35–$50/month (warm) or $50–$70/month (cold)."
  },
  {
    question: "Are electric tankless water heaters safe?",
    answer: "Extremely safe. No combustion means zero carbon monoxide risk. No stored hot water means no scalding risk from tank failures. Safety features include thermal cutoff switches, dry-fire protection (won't activate without water flow), and ground fault protection on most models. The main installation safety concern is proper wire sizing and breaker rating — always use a licensed electrician."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an electric tankless water heater last?",
    answer: "Electric tankless units last 15–20+ years, often outlasting gas models because there's no combustion byproduct corrosion. The heating elements may need replacement every 5–10 years ($30–$50 each, 15-minute swap). Annual descaling in hard-water areas is the most important maintenance task. Many units have outlasted their warranties by 5–10+ years."
  },
  {
    question: "Can an electric tankless water heater heat a whole house?",
    answer: "In warm climates (groundwater above 60°F), yes — a 27–36 kW unit can handle a 2–3 bathroom home. In moderate climates (50–60°F groundwater), a 36 kW unit handles 1–2 fixtures at a time. In cold climates (below 50°F), no single electric unit can serve a whole home — you'll need multiple units or gas. The limiting factor is always the temperature rise vs available kW."
  },
  {
    question: "What wire size do I need for an electric tankless water heater?",
    answer: "Wire size depends on circuit amperage. For 40A circuits: #8 AWG copper. For 50A circuits: #6 AWG copper. For 60A circuits: #6 AWG copper. These are minimum sizes for runs under 50 feet — longer runs may require upsizing. A 36 kW unit typically needs four runs of #8 AWG copper from the panel to the heater location. Always verify with NEC tables and local code."
  },
  {
    question: "Do electric tankless water heaters work with solar panels?",
    answer: "Yes, and it's a great pairing. A 36 kW electric tankless running for 20 minutes uses about 12 kWh. A typical 8 kW residential solar array generates 30–40 kWh/day — enough to offset much or all of the water heating load. Pair the tankless with a timer or smart controller to run heavy usage during peak solar production hours (10am–3pm) for maximum offset."
  },
  {
    question: "Electric tankless vs heat pump water heater: which is better?",
    answer: "Heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) are 2–3× more efficient than electric tankless (COP 3.0–4.0 vs UEF 0.99). A HPWH costs less to operate monthly. However, HPWHs have a tank (standby losses, limited supply), take up more space, produce cool exhaust air (a benefit in summer, a drawback in winter), and cost more upfront ($1,500–$2,500 vs $500–$900). Electric tankless is better for: point-of-use, space-constrained installs, and unlimited hot water needs. HPWHs are better for overall energy savings."
