# Furnace Installation Cost: What to Expect in 2026

A new furnace installation costs **$3,500 to $8,500 for gas** (national average: $5,500), **$2,000 to $5,500 for electric** (average: $3,500), and **$5,000 to $10,000 for oil** (average: $7,200) in 2026. The biggest cost drivers are the efficiency rating (80% AFUE vs. 96%+ AFUE adds $1,500–$3,000), brand choice (budget vs. premium adds $1,000–$2,500), and regional labor rates (which vary by 30–50% across the country).

Here's a complete breakdown of every cost component so you know exactly what you're paying for — and where you might be able to save.

## Hidden Costs and Add-Ons

These are the costs that often surprise homeowners when they get the final invoice:

**Ductwork modifications ($500–$3,000+):** If your new furnace is a different size than the old one, or if existing ducts are undersized, damaged, or leaking, ductwork modifications may be necessary. A thorough contractor will inspect your ductwork and flag any issues in the quote.

**Venting conversion ($300–$800):** Upgrading from an 80% AFUE (non-condensing) furnace to a 90%+ AFUE (condensing) furnace requires replacing the metal flue pipe with PVC venting and adding a condensate drain line. This is a standard part of a high-efficiency upgrade but is sometimes quoted as a separate line item.

**Electrical upgrades ($200–$800):** Some new furnaces require a dedicated electrical circuit, especially high-end units with variable-speed blower motors that draw more current. If your existing wiring is undersized, an electrician may be needed.

**Gas line sizing ($200–$1,000):** A larger furnace or one with a higher BTU input may require a larger-diameter gas line. This is more common when upgrading from an older, smaller unit.

**Asbestos abatement ($500–$3,000):** Homes built before 1980 may have asbestos-containing materials in the existing ductwork, insulation, or flue pipe. Removal requires a licensed abatement contractor — this can add significant cost.

**Code compliance upgrades ($200–$1,500):** If your home's HVAC installation doesn't meet current building codes, the contractor or inspector may require upgrades — such as adding a combustion air supply, installing a CO detector hardwired to the system, or upgrading the flue per current standards.

<Callout type="warning">
**Watch for low-ball quotes that exclude these items.** A quote that seems $1,000–$2,000 lower than competitors may not include permits, ductwork modifications, venting changes, or disposal of the old unit. Always ask: "What is NOT included in this price?" and get the answer in writing.
</Callout>

## How to Get the Best Price

**Get at least 3 quotes.** This is the single most effective way to ensure a fair price. Prices for the same furnace and installation can vary by 30–50% between contractors in the same city.

**Time your installation for the off-season.** Late spring (April–May) and early fall (September–October) are the slowest periods for HVAC contractors. Many offer 10–15% discounts or promotional pricing during these months. Avoid emergency replacements in December and January when demand and prices peak.

**Ask about manufacturer rebates.** Carrier, Trane, Lennox, and other brands periodically offer $200–$1,000 rebates on qualifying equipment. These promotions are most common in spring and fall.

**Check for utility rebates.** Many gas and electric utilities offer rebates for high-efficiency furnaces. Typical rebate: $200–$500 for a 95%+ AFUE furnace. Check your utility's website or the DSIRE database (dsireusa.org).

**Consider financing.** Most HVAC companies offer financing through providers like GreenSky or Synchrony with promotional 0% APR for 12–36 months. If you can pay it off within the promotional period, this is essentially free money. Avoid financing that locks you into high interest rates after the promotional period ends.

**Don't automatically choose the cheapest quote.** The lowest bid may come from an unlicensed contractor, skip permits, or cut corners on ductwork and venting. Poor installation is the #1 cause of furnace inefficiency, comfort problems, and premature failure. Verify that every contractor is licensed, insured, and pulls permits.

## What to Expect on Installation Day

A typical furnace replacement takes **4–8 hours** from start to finish for a straightforward swap. Here's the process:

**Before installation:**
- Contractor performs final measurements and confirms equipment selection.
- You clear a path to the furnace area and move any stored items.
- Contractor pulls necessary permits (if not done during the quoting phase).

**During installation (4–8 hours):**
1. Disconnect and remove old furnace (30–60 minutes).
2. Inspect and modify ductwork connections as needed (30–90 minutes).
3. Set new furnace in place and connect ductwork (60–90 minutes).
4. Connect gas line (gas furnace) or electrical (electric furnace) (30–60 minutes).
5. Install or modify venting (30–90 minutes for condensing conversions).
6. Install condensate drain/pump if needed (15–30 minutes).
7. Connect thermostat wiring (15–30 minutes).
8. System startup, combustion analysis, and testing (30–60 minutes).

**After installation:**
- The contractor walks you through the new system's operation, thermostat, and filter location.
- They should provide all warranty registration information and paperwork.
- A city or county inspector will schedule a follow-up inspection (usually within 1–2 weeks).

<Callout type="tip">
**Insist on a combustion analysis at startup.** A proper installation includes measuring gas pressure at the manifold, verifying the temperature rise across the heat exchanger, and performing a combustion analysis to ensure CO levels are within spec. This 15-minute test confirms the furnace is operating safely and efficiently. If your contractor doesn't do this automatically, ask for it.

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **National average installed cost:** Gas furnace $5,500, electric furnace $3,500, oil furnace $7,200.
- **The efficiency tier drives the biggest price difference.** Going from 80% to 96%+ AFUE adds $1,500–$3,000 to the installed cost but can save $200–$400/year on fuel in cold climates.
- **Get at least 3 quotes** and compare them line by line. Verify each contractor is licensed and insured.
- **Install in the off-season** (April–May or September–October) for 10–15% savings.
- **Watch for hidden costs:** ductwork modifications, venting conversion, code upgrades, and asbestos abatement can add $500–$3,000+ to the base price.
- **Don't let the cheapest quote win automatically.** Installation quality affects efficiency, comfort, safety, and system lifespan for 15–25 years.
- **Check for rebates:** Manufacturer rebates ($200–$1,000), utility rebates ($200–$500), and the federal tax credit for high-efficiency equipment can significantly reduce your net cost.
- **Insist on a combustion analysis** at startup to confirm safe, efficient operation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How much does a new furnace cost installed in 2026?",
    answer: "The average gas furnace costs $5,500 fully installed, with a range of $3,500 to $8,500 depending on efficiency, brand, and region. Electric furnaces average $3,500 installed ($2,000–$5,500). Oil furnaces average $7,200 installed ($5,000–$10,000). These totals include equipment, labor, permits, and standard accessories."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does furnace installation take?",
    answer: "A straightforward furnace replacement (same fuel type, similar size) takes 4–8 hours in a single day. More complex installations — such as converting from oil to gas, running new gas lines, or significant ductwork modifications — may take 1–2 days. Most standard replacements are completed in one visit."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I repair or replace my old furnace?",
    answer: "Use the 50% rule: if the repair costs more than 50% of a new furnace AND the furnace is over 15 years old, replace it. Also consider the $5,000 rule: multiply the furnace age by the repair cost — if the result exceeds $5,000, lean toward replacement. If the furnace is under 10 years and the repair is minor, repair is usually the better choice."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there tax credits for new furnaces in 2026?",
    answer: "The federal Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (under the Inflation Reduction Act) allows homeowners to claim up to $600 for a qualifying high-efficiency gas furnace or $2,000 for a qualifying heat pump. The furnace must meet ENERGY STAR Most Efficient criteria. State and utility rebates may be available in addition to federal credits. Check dsireusa.org for current incentives in your area."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a high-efficiency furnace worth the extra cost?",
    answer: "In cold climates with annual heating bills over $1,000, yes. Upgrading from 80% to 96% AFUE costs $1,500–$3,000 more but saves $200–$400/year in fuel. The payback period is typically 5–12 years, and you get 15–25 years of savings. In mild climates with low heating bills ($400–$600/year), the payback takes much longer and may not be worth the premium."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in a furnace installation quote?",
    answer: "A complete quote should include: equipment (furnace, thermostat), labor, permits and inspections, disposal of the old unit, any necessary venting or ductwork modifications, condensate drain/pump (for condensing furnaces), and startup/commissioning. Ask specifically: what is NOT included in this price? Get it in writing."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I negotiate furnace installation prices?",
    answer: "Yes, to a degree. Having multiple quotes gives you leverage — you can show a lower quote and ask the preferred contractor to match or come close. Off-season installation, paying in full upfront (avoiding financing costs), and bundling services (furnace + AC replacement) can all reduce the price. Most contractors have 10-20% margin on installations."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit to install a furnace?",
    answer: "In most jurisdictions, yes. A mechanical permit is required for furnace installation and typically costs $100–$500. The permit triggers an inspection by a building official who verifies the installation meets code — gas connections, venting, electrical, and safety requirements. An installer who offers to skip the permit to save money is a red flag. Unpermitted work can void warranties and cause problems when selling your home."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose between 80% and 96% AFUE?",
    answer: "Calculate your annual gas heating cost. Multiply it by 0.17 (the approximate savings from upgrading 80% to 96%). If that number is $150+ per year, the 96% furnace pays back within 10–15 years. For a home spending $1,000/year on gas heat, a 96% unit saves about $170/year — a reasonable payback. If you're spending under $500/year, the savings may not justify the premium."
  },
  {
    question: "What brand of furnace should I buy?",
    answer: "For most homeowners, we recommend the Goodman GMVC96 (best value) or Carrier Performance 59TP6 (best mid-range). Both are 96% AFUE two-stage units with variable-speed blowers. For maximum efficiency and comfort, the Carrier Infinity 59MN7 or Lennox SLP98V (both 98.5% AFUE modulating) are the top-tier choices. See our full brand comparison for detailed rankings."
