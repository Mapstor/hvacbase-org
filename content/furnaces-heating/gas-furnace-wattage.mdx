# How Many Watts Does a Gas Furnace Use? (Blower Motor Power)

A gas furnace typically uses **300 to 800 watts** of electricity during a heating cycle — far less than the 10,000–24,000 watts an electric furnace consumes. About 80–90% of that electricity goes to the blower motor, with the rest powering the gas valve, inducer motor, control board, and igniter. A variable-speed (ECM) blower uses 75–200 watts on low speed versus 400–700 watts for a single-speed motor — saving $50–$150/year in electricity.

This matters for sizing a backup generator, understanding your electricity bill, and recognizing the hidden electrical operating cost beyond just gas.

## Annual Electricity Cost

<ComparisonTable
  title="Gas Furnace Electricity Cost — 2026"
  headers={["Blower Type", "Avg Watts", "Monthly Cost*", "Heating Season Cost*"]}
  rows={[
    ["Single-speed (PSC)", "550W avg", "$21–$32", "$126–$190"],
    ["Multi-speed", "350–500W avg", "$13–$29", "$80–$173"],
    ["Variable-speed (ECM)", "150–350W avg", "$7–$27", "$43–$161"],

/>

Variable-speed ECM blowers save $50–$150/year in electricity versus single-speed motors. They also deliver better comfort and quieter operation. The $400–$800 upgrade cost pays back in 3–8 years from electricity savings alone — plus the comfort benefits.

## Generator Sizing for a Gas Furnace

A gas furnace needs electricity for the blower, controls, and igniter — so it won't work during a power outage without a generator or battery backup.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Generator Sizing for Gas Furnaces"
  headers={["Furnace Type", "Running Watts", "Startup Surge Watts*", "Minimum Generator Size"]}
  rows={[
    ["Small furnace (single-speed)", "500W", "1,500–2,000W", "2,000W"],
    ["Medium furnace (single-speed)", "700W", "2,000–2,500W", "3,000W"],
    ["Large furnace (single-speed)", "800W", "2,500–3,000W", "3,500W"],
    ["Any furnace (variable-speed ECM)", "200–500W", "500–1,000W*", "1,500–2,000W"],
  ]}
  footnote="*Single-speed PSC motors have high startup surge (3-4x running watts). ECM variable-speed motors have soft-start capability with minimal surge. Always size generator for surge watts, not running watts."
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**A 3,500–5,000 watt portable generator** is sufficient to run most gas furnaces plus a few essentials (lights, refrigerator, phone charging). If you have a variable-speed furnace, you can get by with a smaller 2,000W generator. Always run the generator outdoors and at least 20 feet from windows and doors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.

## Gas Furnace vs. Electric Furnace Wattage

<ComparisonTable
  title="Electricity Usage: Gas vs. Electric Furnace"
  headers={["Specification", "Gas Furnace", "Electric Furnace"]}
  rows={[
    ["Operating wattage", "300–800W", "10,000–24,000W"],
    ["Monthly electricity (winter)", "$15–$35", "$250–$550"],
    ["Can run on portable generator?", "Yes (2,000–5,000W)", "No (needs 30,000W+)"],
    ["Works during power outage (with generator)?", "Yes — easily", "Impractical"],
  ]}
/>

This massive wattage difference is why gas furnaces remain practical during power outages with a modest generator, while electric furnaces are essentially useless without grid power.

## Real-World Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: The Millers — Generator Sizing in Ice Storm (Louisville, KY)**
During a winter ice storm that knocked out power for 3 days, the Millers ran their gas furnace on a 3,500W portable generator ($450). The furnace (single-speed PSC blower) drew about 600W running. They also powered their refrigerator (150W), a few LED lights (30W), and phone chargers. Total load: ~800W running, well within the generator's capacity. Their house stayed at 65°F while neighbors with electric heat had no option.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: The Nguyens — ECM Motor Savings (Denver, CO)**
When the Nguyens replaced their 18-year-old furnace (single-speed PSC blower, 600W) with a new 96% AFUE model with a variable-speed ECM blower (average 200W during heating), their winter electricity bill dropped by $18/month. Over a 6-month heating season, that's $108/year in electricity savings — on top of the gas savings from the higher AFUE rating.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- A gas furnace uses **300–800 watts** — mostly from the blower motor. This is tiny compared to an electric furnace (10,000–24,000W).
- **Variable-speed ECM blowers** use 60–75% less electricity than single-speed PSC motors, saving $50–$150/year.
- A **3,500–5,000W portable generator** can power a gas furnace during outages. Electric furnaces cannot practically run on generators.
- The **startup surge** from single-speed motors is 3–4× the running watts — size your generator for surge, not running watts.
- **Annual electricity cost** for a gas furnace blower: $43–$190 depending on motor type and runtime. A small but real addition to your heating costs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How many watts does a gas furnace blower use?",
    answer: "A single-speed PSC blower motor uses 400-700 watts. A variable-speed ECM blower motor uses 75-500 watts depending on speed — typically averaging 150-350W during heating. The blower is the largest electrical load in a gas furnace, accounting for 80-90% of total power draw."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a gas furnace run on a portable generator?",
    answer: "Yes. A gas furnace typically needs only 300-800 watts running and 1,500-3,000 watts for startup surge. A 3,500-5,000 watt portable generator handles this easily with room to spare for other essentials. Variable-speed furnaces need even less — a 2,000W generator may be sufficient."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a gas furnace work without electricity?",
    answer: "No. Even though the fuel is gas, a gas furnace requires electricity for the blower motor, control board, gas valve, igniter, and inducer motor. Without electricity, the furnace cannot operate. You need either grid power, a generator, or a battery backup system."
  },
  {
    question: "How much electricity does a gas furnace use per month?",
    answer: "A gas furnace with a single-speed blower costs approximately $20-$35/month in electricity during winter (at $0.16/kWh). A variable-speed ECM blower reduces this to $7-$27/month. Over a 6-month heating season, the total electricity cost is $43-$190. This is in addition to your gas fuel cost."
  },
  {
    question: "What size UPS or battery backup do I need for a gas furnace?",
    answer: "For short outages (1-4 hours), a 1,500-2,000W UPS with a large battery bank can keep a furnace running. For extended outages, a generator is more practical. Some homeowners install a dedicated battery backup (like a Tesla Powerwall at 13.5 kWh) that can run a gas furnace for 15-40+ hours depending on duty cycle."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a gas furnace increase my electric bill?",
    answer: "Yes, modestly. The blower motor adds $43-$190 to your electricity bill over the heating season. This is often overlooked when comparing gas vs. electric heating costs. However, it's a small fraction of the total heating cost — gas fuel typically accounts for 85-95% of the operating cost, with electricity making up the remaining 5-15%."
  },
  {
    question: "What is an ECM blower motor?",
    answer: "ECM stands for Electronically Commutated Motor — a brushless DC motor that adjusts its speed based on demand. Unlike a single-speed PSC motor that runs at one speed (full blast), an ECM motor can run at any speed from very low to full capacity. Benefits include 60-75% less electricity use, quieter operation, better humidity control, and more even temperatures. ECM motors are standard on mid-range and premium furnaces."
  },
  {
    question: "How many watts does a furnace igniter use?",
    answer: "A hot surface igniter draws 80-200 watts but only runs for 30-60 seconds per heating cycle — so its contribution to total electricity use is negligible. Igniters glow at 1,800-2,500°F to ignite the gas, then shut off once the flame sensor confirms ignition. You wouldn't even notice the igniter's power draw on your electric bill."
