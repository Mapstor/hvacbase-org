# Furnace vs Heat Pump: Which Is Better? (14 Differences Compared)

A gas furnace is better for cold climates (below 25°F design temperatures) and areas with cheap natural gas, while a heat pump is better for mild-to-moderate climates and homes that need both heating and cooling in a single system. The ideal choice for your home depends on your climate zone, local fuel prices, existing infrastructure, and whether you prioritize the lowest operating cost or the lowest upfront cost.

Here's the bottom line: in Climate Zones 1–4 (roughly the southern two-thirds of the U.S.), heat pumps typically win on total cost of ownership. In Zones 5–7 (northern states), gas furnaces still dominate — though cold-climate heat pumps are closing the gap fast.

Let's break down each factor in detail.

## 1. How They Work: Fundamentally Different

A gas furnace creates heat by burning natural gas in a combustion chamber. The flame heats a metal heat exchanger, and a blower pushes air across it into your ducts. It's a heat-generation system — fuel in, heat out.

A heat pump doesn't create heat — it moves it. Even in cold outdoor air, there's thermal energy available. The heat pump uses a refrigerant cycle (the same technology as your refrigerator, but in reverse) to absorb heat from outdoor air and release it inside. In summer, it reverses to work as an air conditioner.

This difference explains why heat pumps can be 200–400% efficient — they're not converting electricity to heat (which maxes out at 100%), they're using electricity to transport heat (which can move 2–4× more heat energy than the electricity consumed).

## 2. Heating + Cooling: The System Cost Advantage

This is the heat pump's single biggest advantage. A heat pump replaces both your furnace AND your air conditioner in one system.

  headers={["System Configuration", "Equipment", "Installed Cost", "Annual Operating Cost (Heating + Cooling)"]}

  ]}

/>

<Callout type="tip">
**The dual-fuel system is the best-of-both-worlds approach.** It pairs a heat pump with a gas furnace. The heat pump handles heating when outdoor temperatures are above 30–35°F (when it's most efficient). The gas furnace kicks in below that threshold when the heat pump's efficiency drops. This configuration delivers the lowest possible operating costs in cold climates while ensuring reliable heat on the coldest days.
</Callout>

## 3. Efficiency: Heat Pumps Win on Paper, But Climate Matters

A gas furnace's efficiency is measured by AFUE — the percentage of fuel converted to heat. Top gas furnaces hit 98.5% AFUE.

A heat pump's heating efficiency is measured by HSPF2 (Heating Seasonal Performance Factor) or COP (Coefficient of Performance). These reflect how much heat is delivered per unit of electricity consumed.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Efficiency Comparison by Temperature"
  headers={["Outdoor Temperature", "Gas Furnace (96% AFUE)", "Heat Pump COP", "Heat Pump Equivalent AFUE"]}
  rows={[
    ["50°F", "96%", "3.5–4.5", "350–450%"],
    ["40°F", "96%", "3.0–3.8", "300–380%"],
    ["30°F", "96%", "2.5–3.2", "250–320%"],
    ["20°F", "96%", "2.0–2.8", "200–280%"],
    ["10°F", "96%", "1.5–2.3", "150–230%"],
    ["0°F", "96%", "1.2–2.0", "120–200%"],
    ["-10°F", "96%", "1.0–1.5*", "100–150%*"],
  ]}
  footnote="*Cold-climate heat pumps (e.g., Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat) maintain higher COP at low temperatures than standard models. Below -10°F to -15°F, most heat pumps rely on backup heat."
/>

Key insight: a gas furnace delivers the same efficiency regardless of outdoor temperature. A heat pump's efficiency drops as it gets colder outside. At around 25–35°F (depending on the model), the heat pump's COP drops enough that its operating cost per BTU approaches or exceeds that of a gas furnace.

## 4. Operating Cost: Depends on Climate and Fuel Prices

## 5–6. Upfront Cost: Furnace Wins Alone, Heat Pump Wins as a System

If you only need heating, a gas furnace is $2,000–$5,000 cheaper to install than a heat pump. But most homes need both heating AND cooling. When you factor in the cost of a separate air conditioner for the furnace system, the heat pump is often less expensive as a complete HVAC system.

## 7. Cold Weather Performance

This is the gas furnace's strongest advantage. A gas furnace produces the same BTU output whether it's 40°F or -20°F outside. A heat pump's output drops as temperatures fall because there's less thermal energy to extract from colder air.

Standard heat pumps lose roughly 40–50% of their rated capacity at 17°F — the temperature at which most heat pumps are rated. Cold-climate heat pumps (hyper-heat models) maintain higher capacity down to -5°F to -15°F, but they still need electric backup heat for the most extreme cold.

<Callout type="info">
**Cold-climate heat pump technology has improved dramatically.** Models like the Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat (MSZ-FS), Bosch IDS 2.0, and Carrier Infinity 25VNA4 can operate at full rated capacity down to -5°F to -15°F with COP above 1.5. For most of the continental U.S., these units can handle 95%+ of winter hours without backup heat. Still, in the most extreme northern climates (Alaska, northern Minnesota, Montana), a gas furnace remains the most reliable primary heat source.
</Callout>

## 8. Supply Air Temperature: The "Comfort" Factor

One of the most common complaints from homeowners switching from a furnace to a heat pump: "the air doesn't feel as warm." This is because:

- Gas furnace supply air: 120–140°F (feels noticeably warm from the register)
- Heat pump supply air: 90–110°F (feels tepid, especially below 30°F outdoors)

The heat pump IS heating your home — 95°F air is still warmer than your body temperature and your 68°F room — but the psychological perception of cooler supply air makes some homeowners feel like the system "isn't working." This is normal and doesn't mean the heat pump is underperforming.

Modulating heat pumps with variable-speed air handlers minimize this issue by running longer at lower output, maintaining a more consistent supply temperature.

## 9. Lifespan

Gas furnaces typically outlast heat pumps because the heat exchanger — the component most likely to fail — is a passive metal structure with no moving parts. Heat pumps have outdoor compressors and reversing valves that experience more wear.

Average lifespans:
- Gas furnace: 18–20 years (range: 15–25)
- Heat pump: 12–15 years (range: 10–20)
- Gas furnace + AC system: 15–20 years (AC may need replacement first)

The shorter heat pump lifespan partially offsets its operating cost savings. If a heat pump saves $200/year but needs replacement 5 years sooner, the net savings is reduced by the replacement cost premium.

## 10. Maintenance

Gas furnaces need annual professional maintenance: heat exchanger inspection, burner cleaning, flame sensor cleaning, gas connection check, and safety control testing. Cost: $80–$200 per visit.

Heat pumps need twice-yearly maintenance — once before heating season and once before cooling season — because they run year-round. Each visit costs $75–$175. Annual maintenance total: $150–$350.

Both systems benefit from regular filter changes (every 1–3 months), which homeowners can handle themselves.

## 11. Safety: No CO Risk with Heat Pumps

Gas furnaces produce carbon monoxide (CO) as a byproduct of combustion. A properly functioning furnace vents all CO safely outside, but a cracked heat exchanger, blocked flue, or backdrafting can introduce CO into your living space. CO is odorless and can be lethal.

Heat pumps have zero combustion, zero CO risk. This is a meaningful safety advantage, especially for tightly sealed modern homes with less natural ventilation.

<Callout type="warning">
**If you have a gas furnace, install CO detectors on every floor of your home, including near sleeping areas.** Test them monthly and replace batteries annually. CO poisoning from furnaces is responsible for hundreds of ER visits each year.
</Callout>

## 12–14. Environmental Impact, Noise, and Other Factors

**Environmental:** Heat pumps produce less carbon emissions than gas furnaces in most of the U.S., especially in states with cleaner electricity grids. As the grid continues to decarbonize, the heat pump advantage grows over time.

**Noise:** Gas furnaces are quieter overall because the noisy components (blower) are indoors and insulated, with no outdoor unit. Heat pumps have an outdoor compressor that generates 55–75 dB — roughly the volume of a normal conversation to a running dishwasher. This can be a concern for bedroom windows or close neighbors.

**Resale value:** Heat pumps are increasingly seen as a premium feature, particularly in mild-to-moderate climates. In cold climates, a dual-fuel system (heat pump + gas furnace) adds the most value.

## Real-World Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: The Millers — Minneapolis, MN (Zone 6)**
Chose a 96% gas furnace ($5,200 installed) + 16 SEER AC ($4,100 installed) = $9,300 total. Annual heating cost: $1,150. Annual cooling cost: $350. Total: $1,500/year.
A comparable heat pump system would have cost $8,500 with estimated annual cost of $2,100 (including backup heat). The gas + AC combo saves $600/year in this cold climate.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: The Reyes Family — Charlotte, NC (Zone 4)**
Chose a dual-fuel system: heat pump + 80% gas furnace backup, $10,200 installed. The heat pump handles heating down to 30°F (about 85% of winter hours). The gas furnace kicks in below 30°F. Annual heating cost: $580. Annual cooling cost: $450. Total: $1,030/year — saving roughly $350/year over a gas-only system while gaining more efficient cooling.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: The Carters — Tampa, FL (Zone 2)**
Chose a heat pump ($6,800 installed). No gas line, no need for one. Heating costs are minimal ($180/year), cooling costs are the main expense ($850/year). Total: $1,030/year. A gas furnace + AC would have cost more to install and operate in this cooling-dominant climate.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 4: The O'Briens — Portland, ME (Zone 6)**
Chose a Mitsubishi cold-climate heat pump with electric backup ($9,500 installed). No gas line was available, and running one would have cost $8,000. Annual heating cost: $1,600 (lower than the $2,200 they were spending on oil). While a gas furnace would have been cheaper to operate ($1,000/year), the gas infrastructure cost made the heat pump the better total investment. They'll break even within 7 years compared to the gas conversion option.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Is a heat pump cheaper to run than a gas furnace?",
    answer: "In mild climates (Zones 1-3), yes — a heat pump typically costs 10-30% less to operate for heating than a gas furnace at national average fuel prices. In cold climates (Zones 5-7), a gas furnace is usually 20-40% cheaper because the heat pump's efficiency drops significantly in cold weather. Zone 4 is the tipping point where costs are roughly similar."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a heat pump replace a gas furnace in cold climates?",
    answer: "Modern cold-climate heat pumps (like Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat) can handle temperatures down to -15°F and serve as the primary heat source in most of the continental U.S. However, in very cold climates, they typically need electric or gas backup for the coldest days and cost more to operate than gas alone. A dual-fuel system (heat pump + gas furnace backup) is the optimal solution for cold climates."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a heat pump last compared to a furnace?",
    answer: "Gas furnaces last 15-25 years (average 18-20). Heat pumps last 10-20 years (average 12-15). The shorter heat pump lifespan is because it runs year-round for both heating and cooling, and the outdoor compressor experiences more wear than a furnace's indoor heat exchanger. However, a heat pump replaces both a furnace AND an AC, so you're comparing one unit's replacement cost against two."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does a heat pump feel like it's blowing cold air?",
    answer: "Heat pump supply air (90-110°F) is cooler than gas furnace supply air (120-140°F), which can feel 'cool' at the register even though it's well above room temperature. This is most noticeable on cold days when heat pump output drops. It's normal operation — the system IS heating your home, just at a lower supply temperature. Variable-speed heat pumps minimize this by running longer at lower output for more consistent temperatures."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a dual-fuel system?",
    answer: "A dual-fuel (or hybrid) system combines a heat pump with a gas furnace. The heat pump handles heating above a set temperature (usually 30-40°F) where it's more efficient. Below that temperature, the gas furnace takes over. This provides the lowest possible operating cost across all temperatures. The downside is higher upfront cost ($8,000-$16,000 installed) compared to either system alone."
  },
  {
    question: "Do heat pumps work in Minnesota or Wisconsin?",
    answer: "Yes, but with caveats. Cold-climate heat pumps can handle most Minnesota/Wisconsin winter days. However, they'll need backup heat for the coldest periods (below -10°F to -15°F), and their operating cost advantage over gas is reduced or eliminated in these climates. A dual-fuel system is the best approach for extreme cold — the heat pump handles 60-75% of winter hours, and the gas furnace covers the rest."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I replace my furnace with a heat pump?",
    answer: "Consider a heat pump replacement if: (1) your AC also needs replacement, (2) you're in a mild-to-moderate climate, (3) you don't have a gas line, or (4) you're motivated by lower carbon emissions. Keep your furnace if: (1) your AC still works, (2) you're in a very cold climate, (3) gas is cheap in your area, or (4) you prefer the warmth feel of furnace heat."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there tax credits for heat pumps in 2026?",
    answer: "Yes, the Inflation Reduction Act provides federal tax credits for qualifying heat pumps installed through 2032. Homeowners can claim up to $2,000 per year for qualified heat pump installations. ENERGY STAR certified models that meet the highest efficiency tiers qualify. Some states and utilities offer additional rebates. Check the DSIRE database (dsireusa.org) for current incentives in your area."
  },
  {
    question: "What size heat pump do I need to replace my furnace?",
    answer: "Heat pump sizing is more complex than furnace sizing because you need to account for both heating and cooling loads. A Manual J load calculation is essential — both the heating load (in BTU) and cooling load (in tons) must be calculated. Oversizing a heat pump is even more problematic than oversizing a furnace because it causes short cycling in cooling mode, which reduces dehumidification. Always insist on a proper load calculation."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a mini-split heat pump an alternative to a furnace?",
    answer: "Yes. Ductless mini-split heat pumps are particularly effective alternatives when: (1) you don't have existing ductwork, (2) you're heating individual rooms or zones, (3) you're supplementing an existing system, or (4) you're building a high-efficiency home. A multi-zone mini-split system (one outdoor unit, multiple indoor heads) can heat and cool an entire home. They're extremely efficient (SEER 20-33, HSPF 10-15) but may struggle as the sole heat source in very cold climates without supplemental heat."
