# Best Electric Furnace Brands & Cost (2026 Buyer's Guide)

The best electric furnaces in 2026 come from **Goodman** (best value at $800–$1,400), **Rheem** (best mid-range at $1,000–$1,800), and **Carrier** (best premium at $1,500–$2,500). Electric furnaces are simpler than gas units — no combustion, no flue, no gas line — so brand differences are less dramatic. Total installed cost ranges from **$2,000 to $5,500**, making electric furnaces the cheapest HVAC heating option to install, though they're the most expensive to operate due to high electricity costs.

## What to Look For in an Electric Furnace

Since all electric furnaces are essentially 100% efficient (every watt becomes heat), the key differentiators are:

**Blower motor type.** Variable-speed ECM blowers are quieter, use 60–75% less electricity for the fan, and provide better comfort. The fan electricity savings partially offset the higher operating cost.

**Sequenced heating elements.** Better electric furnaces activate their heating elements in stages (sequencers) rather than all at once. This reduces the initial power surge and provides more gradual, even heating. Look for 3–6 element stages.

**Circuit breaker and wiring requirements.** Electric furnaces draw 30–100+ amps depending on kW rating. A 15 kW unit needs a 60-amp circuit; a 23 kW unit needs two 60-amp circuits. Verify your electrical panel has capacity before purchasing.

**Cabinet and build quality.** Premium brands use heavier-gauge steel, better insulation, and more robust wiring connections. This matters less than with gas furnaces (no combustion stress) but still affects longevity.

<Callout type="warning">
**Electric furnaces in cold climates are extremely expensive to operate.** A 20 kW electric furnace running 10 hours/day at $0.16/kWh costs $32/day — roughly $960/month in the coldest winter months. If you're in a cold climate without gas access, a heat pump with electric backup strips is almost always a better investment than a standalone electric furnace.
</Callout>

## When an Electric Furnace Makes Sense

Electric furnaces are the right choice in a narrow set of circumstances: mild climates with low heating loads where the annual cost difference versus gas is small, homes without gas access where running a gas line is impractical, backup/supplemental heating for a heat pump system (electric strips in the air handler), additions, garages, or workshops where installing gas is prohibitively expensive, and areas with very cheap electricity (under $0.08/kWh).

## Real-World Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: The Robinsons — Budget Install in Jacksonville, FL**
The Robinsons needed an electric furnace for their 1,600 sq ft home in mild-winter Florida. They chose a Goodman 10 kW unit with a variable-speed blower. Installed cost: $2,800. Annual heating cost: approximately $320 (mild climate, low usage). The low installation cost and minimal maintenance made sense for their short, mild heating season.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: The Thompsons — Costly Mistake in Pittsburgh, PA**
The Thompsons installed a 20 kW electric furnace for $3,200 in their 2,000 sq ft home because it was $3,000 cheaper than a gas furnace installation (no gas line to their street). Their first winter heating bill: $2,800. A heat pump with electric backup would have cost $6,500 installed but cut heating costs to approximately $1,200/year. The $3,300 extra upfront investment would have paid back in under 3 years.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- Electric furnaces cost **$2,000–$5,500 installed** — the cheapest upfront heating option.
- Operating costs are **2–3× higher than gas** in most markets. Budget $1,200–$2,500/year for a typical home.
- All electric furnaces are essentially **100% efficient** — brand choice comes down to blower motor type, build quality, and warranty.
- **Best budget pick: Goodman.** Best mid-range: Rheem. Best premium: Carrier.
- Electric furnaces make the most sense in **mild climates** and homes without gas access.
- In **cold climates without gas,** a heat pump with electric backup strips is almost always a better investment.
- Prioritize a **variable-speed ECM blower** — the electricity savings for the fan motor partially offset the high heating cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How much does an electric furnace cost to install?",
    answer: "Total installed cost ranges from $2,000 to $5,500, with a national average of about $3,500. This includes the furnace ($800-$2,500), labor ($800-$2,000), electrical work, and permits. Electric furnaces are cheaper to install than gas furnaces because they don't require gas lines, venting, or combustion air provisions."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run an electric furnace per month?",
    answer: "In moderate-to-cold climates, expect $200-$550 per month during winter at national average electricity rates ($0.16/kWh). In mild climates, $50-$150/month. A 20 kW electric furnace running 8 hours/day costs about $25.60/day, or $768/month. These costs are significantly higher than gas furnace operating costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Is an electric furnace better than a heat pump?",
    answer: "In almost every scenario, a heat pump is better than an electric furnace. Heat pumps deliver 2-3x more heat per watt of electricity because they transfer heat rather than generating it. A heat pump costs more upfront but saves 50-65% on heating costs. The only advantage of an electric furnace is lower installation cost and simpler maintenance."
  },
  {
    question: "Do electric furnaces need maintenance?",
    answer: "Electric furnaces require minimal maintenance compared to gas. There's no combustion, no heat exchanger to crack, no gas connections to check. Basic maintenance includes: filter changes (every 1-3 months), occasional blower motor inspection, and checking electrical connections every 2-3 years. Annual professional tune-ups are recommended but less critical than for gas furnaces."
  },
  {
    question: "Are electric furnaces safe?",
    answer: "Yes — electric furnaces are arguably the safest type. There's no combustion, no carbon monoxide risk, no gas leaks, and no flue to maintain. The main safety concern is the high-amperage electrical connections, which should be installed and serviced by a licensed electrician or HVAC technician."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an electric furnace last?",
    answer: "Electric furnaces typically last 20-30 years — longer than gas furnaces (15-25 years) because there's no combustion stress on components. The heating elements may need replacement after 15-20 years ($100-$300 each), and the blower motor may need replacement after 10-15 years ($300-$600). Overall, electric furnaces are the longest-lasting furnace type."
  },
  {
    question: "What size breaker do I need for an electric furnace?",
    answer: "It depends on the kW rating: a 10 kW unit typically needs a 40-60 amp circuit, a 15 kW unit needs a 60-80 amp circuit, and a 20+ kW unit often requires two 60-amp circuits. Check your electrical panel capacity before installation — you may need a panel upgrade ($1,500-$3,000) if you don't have available capacity."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I replace a gas furnace with an electric furnace?",
    answer: "Technically yes, but it's usually not advisable. Electric furnaces cost 2-3x more to operate than gas. If your gas line works and gas is available, stick with gas. If you want to go all-electric, a heat pump is a much better investment than an electric furnace. The only scenario where gas-to-electric furnace makes sense is if you're permanently disconnecting gas service and don't want a heat pump."
