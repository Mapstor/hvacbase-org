# Best Gas Furnace Brands: Cost & Efficiency Compared (2026)

Carrier, Trane, and Lennox consistently lead the gas furnace market in 2026, offering the highest efficiency ratings (up to 98.5% AFUE), the longest warranties, and the most advanced comfort features — but they also cost 30–50% more than value brands like Goodman and Rheem. The best brand for you depends on whether you prioritize premium comfort technology, rock-bottom installed price, or the longest warranty coverage.

We compared 10 major gas furnace brands across efficiency, reliability, warranty, installed cost, and feature set. Below is the complete breakdown with real pricing data, model-by-model comparisons, and our recommendations for different budgets and climates.

**Understanding brand families:** Many "different" brands are actually made by the same parent company on identical or near-identical platforms. Carrier and Bryant share components. Trane and American Standard are nearly identical units with different nameplates. Goodman and Amana are both Daikin products. Lennox owns Heil and Tempstar through Allied Air. The main differences are often the dealer network, warranty terms, and pricing tiers.

## Detailed Brand Reviews

### 1. Carrier — Best Overall Technology

Carrier invented the modern air conditioning system in 1902 and remains an industry leader. Their furnace lineup spans entry-level to ultra-premium, with the Infinity series representing the top tier.

**Top Model: Carrier Infinity 59MN7**
- AFUE: 98.5% (highest available tied with Lennox)
- Type: Modulating gas valve, variable-speed ECM blower
- Sound: As low as 40 dB (whisper-quiet)
- Smart connectivity: Infinity System control with Wi-Fi, zoning compatible
- Warranty: Lifetime limited heat exchanger, 10-year parts (when registered)

**Budget Model: Carrier Comfort 59SC2**
- AFUE: 80%
- Type: Single-stage, multi-speed blower
- Warranty: 20-year heat exchanger, 5-year parts

<ComparisonTable
  title="Carrier Furnace Lineup — 2026"
  headers={["Model", "AFUE", "Stages", "Blower", "Installed Cost", "Key Feature"]}
  rows={[
    ["Infinity 59MN7", "98.5%", "Modulating", "Variable-speed", "$7,000–$9,000", "Greenspeed intelligence"],
    ["Infinity 59TN6", "96.5%", "Two-stage", "Variable-speed", "$5,800–$7,500", "Best value in premium tier"],
    ["Performance 59TP6", "96.5%", "Two-stage", "Variable-speed", "$4,800–$6,500", "Mid-range workhorse"],
    ["Comfort 59SC5", "80%", "Single-stage", "Multi-speed", "$4,500–$5,500", "Budget with solid build"],
  ]}
/>

**Pros:** Industry-leading modulating technology, excellent smart home integration, strong dealer network.
**Cons:** Premium pricing, some parts are proprietary, Infinity system controls add cost.

### 2. Trane — Best Reliability and Durability

Trane has built its reputation on ruggedness. Their furnaces are tested under extreme conditions, and the brand consistently ranks at or near the top in contractor reliability surveys. Trane's manufacturing is primarily U.S.-based.

**Top Model: Trane XV95/S9V2**
- AFUE: 97.3%
- Type: Modulating (variable-speed fan and burner)
- Sound: Extremely quiet operation with insulated cabinet
- Smart connectivity: ComfortLink II communicating system
- Warranty: Lifetime limited heat exchanger, 10-year functional parts (registered)

<ComparisonTable
  title="Trane Furnace Lineup — 2026"
  headers={["Model", "AFUE", "Stages", "Blower", "Installed Cost", "Key Feature"]}
  rows={[
    ["S9V2 (XV95)", "97.3%", "Modulating", "Variable-speed", "$7,500–$9,500", "Top reliability ratings"],
    ["S9X2 (XR95)", "96%", "Two-stage", "Variable-speed", "$5,500–$7,500", "Popular mid-premium choice"],
    ["S8X2 (XR80)", "80%", "Two-stage", "Multi-speed", "$4,800–$6,000", "Two-stage at 80% AFUE"],
    ["S8X1 (XT80)", "80%", "Single-stage", "Multi-speed", "$4,500–$5,500", "Entry-level Trane quality"],
  ]}
/>

**Pros:** Exceptional build quality, excellent contractor reputation, strong resale value impact.
**Cons:** Highest prices in the industry, limited dealer network (Trane Comfort Specialists), fewer model options than Carrier.

### 3. Lennox — Best Efficiency and Quietest Operation

Lennox pushes the boundaries of efficiency and noise reduction. Their SLP98V is one of only two residential furnaces to achieve 98.5% AFUE, and their sound-insulated cabinets are among the quietest in the industry.

**Top Model: Lennox SLP98V**
- AFUE: 98.5%
- Type: Modulating, variable-speed
- Sound: As low as 43.5 dB with SilentComfort technology
- Smart connectivity: iComfort S30 thermostat integration
- Warranty: Lifetime limited heat exchanger, 10-year parts (registered)

<ComparisonTable
  title="Lennox Furnace Lineup — 2026"
  headers={["Model", "AFUE", "Stages", "Blower", "Installed Cost", "Key Feature"]}
  rows={[
    ["SLP98V", "98.5%", "Modulating", "Variable-speed", "$7,500–$10,000+", "Highest efficiency + quietest"],
    ["EL296V", "96%", "Two-stage", "Variable-speed", "$5,500–$7,500", "Strong mid-premium option"],
    ["ML296V", "96%", "Two-stage", "Variable-speed", "$4,800–$6,500", "Merit series value"],
    ["ML180", "80%", "Single-stage", "Multi-speed", "$4,200–$5,500", "Budget entry point"],
  ]}
/>

**Pros:** Tied for highest efficiency, extremely quiet, excellent smart thermostat ecosystem.
**Cons:** Highest prices overall, dealer-exclusive distribution can limit service options, some proprietary parts.

### 4. Bryant — Premium Features at a Slightly Lower Price

Bryant is Carrier's sister brand, sharing the same parent company and many of the same components. The key difference: Bryant is typically 10–15% less expensive than equivalent Carrier models because of the dealer network positioning.

**Top Model: Bryant Evolution 987M**
- AFUE: 98.5%
- Type: Modulating, variable-speed
- Warranty: Lifetime limited heat exchanger, 10-year parts (registered)

Bryant is an excellent choice if you want Carrier-level technology without the Carrier price tag. The main trade-off is a somewhat smaller dealer network in some areas.

### 5. Rheem/Ruud — Best Mid-Range Value

Rheem (and its sister brand Ruud, which is identical hardware with different branding) offers strong performance at prices 15–25% below premium brands. Their Prestige series is competitive with mid-range Carrier and Trane models.

**Top Model: Rheem Prestige R98MV**
- AFUE: 97%
- Type: Modulating, variable-speed ECM
- Warranty: Lifetime limited heat exchanger, 10-year parts (registered)

<ComparisonTable
  title="Rheem Furnace Lineup — 2026"
  headers={["Model", "AFUE", "Stages", "Blower", "Installed Cost", "Key Feature"]}
  rows={[
    ["Prestige R98MV", "97%", "Modulating", "Variable-speed", "$5,500–$7,000", "Premium features, mid-range price"],
    ["Classic Plus R96V", "96%", "Two-stage", "Variable-speed", "$4,500–$6,000", "Popular choice for contractors"],
    ["Classic R801T", "80%", "Single-stage", "Multi-speed", "$3,500–$4,800", "Reliable budget option"],
  ]}
/>

**Pros:** Strong value proposition, widely available, good contractor reputation.
**Cons:** Not quite at the technology level of Carrier/Trane/Lennox top-tier models, customer service ratings are mixed.

### 6. Goodman/Amana — Best Budget Option

Goodman (and its premium sibling Amana) are manufactured by Daikin, the world's largest HVAC company. Goodman is consistently the lowest-priced brand for equivalent specs, and Amana stands out with the best warranty in the industry: a lifetime unit replacement warranty on the heat exchanger and compressor.

**Top Model: Goodman GMVM97**
- AFUE: 98%
- Type: Modulating, variable-speed
- Installed cost: $4,500–$6,000 (significantly less than equivalent Carrier/Trane)

**Amana AMVM97 (Amana version):**
- Same specs, plus lifetime unit replacement warranty (not just repair — complete replacement)

<ComparisonTable
  title="Goodman Furnace Lineup — 2026"
  headers={["Model", "AFUE", "Stages", "Blower", "Installed Cost", "Key Feature"]}
  rows={[
    ["GMVM97", "98%", "Modulating", "Variable-speed", "$4,500–$6,000", "Premium performance, budget price"],
    ["GMVC96", "96%", "Two-stage", "Variable-speed", "$3,500–$5,000", "Sweet spot for most budgets"],
    ["GMSS92", "92%", "Single-stage", "Multi-speed", "$3,000–$4,200", "High-efficiency entry level"],
    ["GMS80", "80%", "Single-stage", "Multi-speed", "$2,800–$3,800", "Lowest installed cost"],
  ]}
/>

**Pros:** Lowest prices, Amana's unbeatable lifetime warranty, strong Daikin backing, widely available.
**Cons:** Perceived lower quality (though reliability has improved significantly), build quality/cabinet feel not as premium, some contractors report more warranty claims.

### 7–10. Other Notable Brands

**York/Luxaire (Johnson Controls):** Solid mid-range options with up to 98% AFUE. The YP9C modulating furnace competes well with Rheem's Prestige line. Prices typically fall between Goodman and Carrier. York is particularly strong in the Northeast.

**American Standard (Trane Technologies):** Essentially Trane furnaces with a different nameplate and a broader dealer network. If you can't find a Trane dealer nearby, American Standard is the closest equivalent. The Platinum S9V2 matches the Trane XV95 spec-for-spec.

**Heil/Tempstar (Allied Air/Lennox):** These budget-to-mid-range brands share some Lennox DNA and offer competitive pricing. The ion 98 modulating furnace is a strong performer at a lower price point than the Lennox SLP98V.

**Daikin:** Increasingly selling under its own brand name (rather than through Goodman/Amana), Daikin offers strong products backed by the world's largest HVAC manufacturer. Watch for this brand to grow significantly in the U.S. market over the next few years.

## Real-World Brand Comparison Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: Side-by-Side Quotes in Columbus, OH**
A homeowner replacing a 20-year-old furnace in a 1,800 sq ft home got three quotes for 96% AFUE two-stage units:
- **Carrier Performance 59TP6:** $5,800 installed
- **Trane XR95 (S9X2):** $6,200 installed
- **Goodman GMVC96:** $4,400 installed

The Goodman was $1,400 less than the Carrier and $1,800 less than the Trane. All three include lifetime heat exchanger warranties and 10-year parts warranties. The homeowner chose the Carrier for the variable-speed blower and dealer reputation, but acknowledged the Goodman was a strong value.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: Premium Modulating Showdown in Minneapolis, MN**
A homeowner in a 2,600 sq ft home with $1,800/year gas bills wanted the best possible efficiency. Quotes for top-tier modulating units:
- **Carrier Infinity 59MN7 (98.5%):** $8,200 installed
- **Lennox SLP98V (98.5%):** $9,100 installed
- **Goodman GMVM97 (98%):** $5,800 installed

The Goodman modulating unit offered 98% AFUE — just 0.5% below the Carrier and Lennox — for $2,400–$3,300 less. On a $1,800 annual gas bill, the 0.5% efficiency difference saves only about $9/year. The homeowner chose the Goodman and invested the savings in a smart thermostat and duct sealing.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: Warranty-Focused Decision in Detroit, MI**
A homeowner who planned to stay in their home for 25+ years prioritized warranty. They compared:
- **Amana AMVM97:** Lifetime unit replacement warranty + $5,500 installed
- **Trane XV95 (S9V2):** Lifetime heat exchanger, 10-year parts + $8,500 installed

The Amana lifetime unit replacement warranty means if the heat exchanger fails at year 18, Amana replaces the entire furnace, not just the exchanger. The homeowner chose Amana, pocketing $3,000 in savings with arguably better warranty coverage.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **Best overall technology:** Carrier Infinity and Lennox SLP98V (both 98.5% AFUE modulating) — but expect to pay $7,000–$10,000+ installed.
- **Best reliability:** Trane — consistently tops contractor reliability surveys, but carries the highest prices.
- **Best value:** Goodman GMVC96 (96% AFUE, two-stage) — delivers 90% of the performance at 60% of the premium brand price.
- **Best warranty:** Amana AMVM97 — the only lifetime unit replacement warranty in the industry.
- **Don't overpay for the brand name.** In the 96% AFUE two-stage category, a Goodman performs virtually identically to a Carrier at $1,500–$2,000 less. The premium brands justify their cost primarily at the top-tier modulating level.
- **The installer matters as much as the brand.** A top-brand furnace poorly installed will underperform a budget brand properly installed. Always get at least 3 quotes and check contractor reviews, licenses, and references.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What is the most reliable gas furnace brand in 2026?",
    answer: "Trane and Carrier consistently rank as the most reliable gas furnace brands based on contractor surveys and warranty claim data. Trane is particularly known for durability and build quality. However, Goodman (Daikin) has significantly improved reliability in recent years and offers competitive performance at a lower price point."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Goodman a good furnace brand?",
    answer: "Yes, Goodman has improved significantly since being acquired by Daikin (the world's largest HVAC manufacturer) in 2012. Their 96% and 98% AFUE models perform comparably to premium brands. The main trade-offs are slightly less refined cabinet construction and a dealer network that varies in quality. The Amana brand (same company, same hardware) offers an industry-best lifetime unit replacement warranty."
  },
  {
    question: "Are Carrier and Bryant the same furnace?",
    answer: "Nearly identical. Carrier and Bryant are both manufactured by Carrier Global Corporation and share many of the same components, compressors, and heat exchangers. Bryant units are typically 10-15% less expensive because they're positioned as a value tier. The main differences are cosmetic (cabinet color, branding) and the dealer network. If you can find a good Bryant dealer, you're getting essentially Carrier quality at a lower price."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a top-of-the-line gas furnace cost installed?",
    answer: "The most expensive residential gas furnaces in 2026 — the Carrier Infinity 59MN7 and Lennox SLP98V — cost $7,000 to $10,000+ fully installed. These are modulating furnaces with 98.5% AFUE, variable-speed blowers, and ultra-quiet operation. For most homeowners, a mid-range 96% AFUE two-stage unit at $4,500–$6,500 installed provides 95% of the comfort and efficiency benefits."
  },
  {
    question: "What AFUE should I look for in a gas furnace?",
    answer: "For cold climates (heating bills above $1,000/year), target at least 96% AFUE. The energy savings over an 80% unit will pay back the price premium within 7-12 years. For moderate climates, 92-96% AFUE is the sweet spot. For mild climates where you heat less than 3 months per year, even 80% AFUE can make sense since the annual savings from higher efficiency are minimal."
  },
  {
    question: "Which furnace brand has the best warranty?",
    answer: "Amana offers the best warranty in the industry — a lifetime unit replacement limited warranty on the heat exchanger and stainless steel tubular primary heat exchanger. If the heat exchanger fails, Amana replaces the entire furnace, not just the part. Most other major brands offer a lifetime limited heat exchanger warranty plus 10-year parts coverage when properly registered."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I buy a single-stage, two-stage, or modulating furnace?",
    answer: "For most homeowners, a two-stage furnace is the best balance of comfort, efficiency, and cost. It runs at low fire (65-70% capacity) most of the time, providing more even temperatures and lower energy use than single-stage, at $1,000-$2,000 less than modulating. Modulating furnaces are worth the premium if you prioritize the quietest operation and most consistent temperatures. Single-stage is fine for budget-focused buyers in mild climates."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the furnace brand affect my home's resale value?",
    answer: "Yes, to a modest degree. Trane and Carrier are the most recognized premium brands and can positively influence buyer perception. A home listing that mentions a 'new Trane XV95' carries more weight than 'new furnace.' However, the condition and age of the system matters more than the brand name. A 5-year-old Goodman in great shape is more valuable than a 15-year-old Carrier."
  },
  {
    question: "Where are these furnace brands manufactured?",
    answer: "Most major brands have U.S. manufacturing: Trane assembles in Tyler, TX. Carrier has plants in Indianapolis, IN and Collierville, TN. Lennox manufactures in Stuttgart, AR. Goodman/Daikin operates a massive facility in Houston, TX. Rheem manufactures in Fort Smith, AR. While some components may be sourced internationally, the major brands assemble their furnaces in the United States."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find a good installer for my furnace brand?",
    answer: "Start with the manufacturer's dealer locator on their website — authorized dealers receive factory training and can offer full warranty coverage. Get at least 3 quotes, check each contractor's license and insurance, read online reviews, and ask for references. Look for NATE-certified technicians. A good installer should perform a Manual J load calculation, not just match the old furnace's size. The installation quality matters as much as — or more than — the brand you choose."
