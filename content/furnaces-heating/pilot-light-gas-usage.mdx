# How Much Gas Does a Pilot Light Use? (Cost Per Month)

A standard standing pilot light burns approximately **600 to 1,800 BTU per hour**, depending on the appliance. That translates to **5–12 therms of gas per month**, costing roughly **$5–$13/month at the 2026 national average gas price of $1.05/therm**. Over a full year, a single pilot light costs approximately **$60–$156** in gas — and if you have multiple gas appliances with standing pilots (furnace, water heater, fireplace), those costs compound.

<Callout type="info">
**How to calculate your cost:** Pilot BTU/hour × 24 hours × 30 days ÷ 100,000 BTU/therm × your local $/therm = monthly cost. For a 1,000 BTU/hr pilot: 1,000 × 24 × 30 ÷ 100,000 × $1.05 = $7.56/month.
</Callout>

## Multiple Pilot Lights Add Up

Many older homes have 2–3 gas appliances with standing pilot lights. The combined cost is significant:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Total Pilot Light Cost — Multiple Appliances"
  headers={["Scenario", "Pilot Lights", "Combined Monthly Cost", "Annual Cost"]}
  rows={[
    ["Furnace only", "1 pilot (1,000 BTU/hr)", "$7.50", "$90"],
    ["Furnace + water heater", "2 pilots (1,800 BTU/hr total)", "$13.60", "$163"],
    ["Furnace + water heater + fireplace", "3 pilots (3,400 BTU/hr total)", "$25.70", "$308"],
    ["All gas (furnace + WH + fireplace + stove)", "4 pilots (4,000 BTU/hr total)", "$30.25", "$363"],
  ]}
/>

A home with 3 standing pilot lights could save **$200–$300+ per year** by upgrading those appliances to electronic ignition models.

## Pilot Light vs. Electronic Ignition

Modern gas appliances use electronic ignition (either hot surface ignition or direct spark) instead of standing pilot lights. Electronic ignition uses gas only when the burner actually fires — consuming zero fuel when the appliance is idle.

## Should You Turn Off Your Pilot Light in Summer?

For gas furnaces, the pilot light only runs during the heating season (if you shut off the furnace in spring). However, for gas fireplaces and older water heaters with standing pilots, the pilot burns year-round — even when you're not using them.

**Gas fireplace:** Yes, turn off the pilot in summer. A gas fireplace pilot costs $7–$14/month for zero benefit during warm months. That's $28–$56 saved over a 4-month summer. Most gas fireplaces have a clearly labeled pilot switch.

**Gas water heater:** Generally, leave it on. The pilot also helps dry out the combustion chamber, preventing corrosion. The savings from turning it off ($4–$8/month) are modest, and relighting can be inconvenient.

**Gas furnace:** If your furnace has a standing pilot (pre-2010 model), turn it off for the summer. Savings: $7–$9/month × 4 months = $28–$36. When fall arrives, follow the relighting instructions on the furnace.

## Real-World Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: The Hendersons — Three Pilot Lights in Cleveland, OH**
The Hendersons had standing pilots on their furnace (1980s model), water heater (2005), and gas fireplace. Combined annual pilot cost at their local rate of $0.95/therm: $265. They replaced the furnace with a modern electronic ignition model ($5,200), and the water heater was already due for replacement ($1,200 for a new power-vent model with electronic ignition). They also turned off the fireplace pilot in summer. Annual pilot light savings: approximately $215.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: The Chens — Fireplace Pilot Year-Round in Denver, CO**
The Chens' gas fireplace pilot burned year-round at 1,500 BTU/hr. At their gas rate of $0.80/therm, the pilot cost $86/year — yet they only used the fireplace about 30 hours during the winter. The gas used by the pilot actually exceeded the gas used for actual fireplace operation. They installed a battery-operated electronic ignition kit ($150 DIY) that eliminated the standing pilot entirely.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: The Garcias — Mystery Gas Bill Solved in Phoenix, AZ**
The Garcias noticed their summer gas bill was $35/month even though they weren't heating, cooking minimally, and using solar for water heating. The culprit: a standing pilot on their decorative gas fireplace that they'd never turned off. Turning off the pilot reduced their summer gas bill to $12/month (base charges only). Annual savings: approximately $100.

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- A single standing pilot light costs **$60–$160/year** in gas — and most people forget they're running.
- Multiple pilot lights (furnace + water heater + fireplace) can cost **$200–$360/year combined**.
- **Modern electronic ignition uses zero gas when idle** — upgrading to new appliances eliminates pilot light costs entirely.
- **Turn off gas fireplace pilots in summer** — this is the easiest immediate savings ($28–$56).
- **Don't leave the furnace pilot running in summer** if your furnace has a standing pilot (pre-2010 models).
- **Post-2010 furnaces** use electronic ignition and don't have standing pilots — there's nothing to turn off.
- When replacing gas appliances, electronic ignition is now standard — but verify if buying budget or older-stock models.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How much does a pilot light cost per month?",
    answer: "A typical pilot light costs $5-$13 per month, depending on the BTU rating (600-1,800 BTU/hr) and your local gas rate. At the 2026 national average of $1.05/therm, a 1,000 BTU/hr pilot costs about $7.50/month. Furnace pilots are typically $7-$9/month, water heater pilots $4-$8/month, and gas fireplace pilots $8-$14/month."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a pilot light use a lot of gas?",
    answer: "Relative to a furnace's main burner, a pilot light uses a small amount of gas — about 5-12 therms per month compared to 50-100+ therms per month for heating. However, a pilot burns 24/7/365, so the annual cost ($60-$160 per appliance) is meaningful. Homes with multiple pilot lights can spend $200-$360/year on pilot flames alone."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I turn off my pilot light in the summer?",
    answer: "Yes, for gas fireplaces and furnaces with standing pilots (pre-2010 models). A fireplace pilot running all summer costs $28-$56 for zero benefit. Leave water heater pilots on — the savings are modest and the pilot helps prevent combustion chamber corrosion. Modern furnaces with electronic ignition don't have standing pilots to worry about."
  },
  {
    question: "Do modern furnaces have pilot lights?",
    answer: "Most furnaces manufactured after 2010 use electronic ignition (hot surface igniter or direct spark) instead of standing pilot lights. These systems consume no gas when the furnace is off. If your furnace has a PVC vent pipe and was installed in the last 15 years, it almost certainly uses electronic ignition."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a pilot light increase my carbon monoxide risk?",
    answer: "A properly burning pilot light produces minimal CO. However, a pilot in a poorly ventilated area, or one that burns with a yellow/orange flame (indicating incomplete combustion), can produce elevated CO levels. Ensure adequate ventilation around gas appliances and install CO detectors on every floor. A healthy pilot flame is small, steady, and primarily blue."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it safe to turn off a pilot light?",
    answer: "Yes. Turn the gas control valve to the OFF or PILOT-OFF position. This closes the gas supply to both the pilot and main burner. Don't try to blow out the pilot — use the gas valve. When relighting, follow the manufacturer's instructions on the appliance label. If you smell gas after turning off the pilot, leave the area and call your gas company."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I relight a pilot light?",
    answer: "The instructions are printed on most appliances. Generally: (1) Turn the gas control knob to PILOT. (2) Press and hold the knob or pilot button. (3) Use a long lighter or built-in piezo igniter to light the pilot. (4) Continue holding the button for 30-60 seconds after the pilot lights (this heats the thermocouple). (5) Release the button — the pilot should stay lit. (6) Turn the knob to ON."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I convert my furnace from pilot light to electronic ignition?",
    answer: "In most cases, no — not cost-effectively. Converting an old furnace from standing pilot to electronic ignition requires replacing the gas valve, control board, and ignition system — often costing $500-$1,000+ in parts and labor. At that point, you're better off investing in a new furnace ($3,500-$8,500) that comes with electronic ignition, higher efficiency, and a full warranty."
