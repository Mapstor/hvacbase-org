# What Temperature to Set Thermostat in Winter? (Savings by Degree)

The U.S. Department of Energy recommends setting your thermostat to **68°F (20°C) when you're home and awake**, then lowering it by **7–10°F for 8 hours per day** (while sleeping or away). This single adjustment saves approximately **10% on annual heating costs** — about $80–$120/year for the average household. Every 1°F you lower the thermostat below 70°F saves roughly 1–3% on your heating bill, depending on climate severity and home insulation.

Here's the data on exactly how much each degree saves, the best temperature schedules, and how to stay comfortable while cutting costs.

<TableOfContents />

## Savings Per Degree: The Data

<ComparisonTable
  title="Estimated Annual Heating Savings by Thermostat Setting (vs. 72°F baseline)"
  headers={["Thermostat Setting", "Savings vs. 72°F", "Annual Savings*", "Comfort Level"]}
  rows={[
    ["72°F (22°C)", "Baseline", "$0", "Warm — most people's comfort max"],
    ["71°F (21.5°C)", "~2%", "$16–$30", "Barely noticeable difference"],
    ["70°F (21°C)", "~4%", "$32–$60", "Standard comfortable"],
    ["69°F (20.5°C)", "~6%", "$48–$90", "Comfortable with light clothing"],
    ["68°F (20°C) — DOE recommended", "~8%", "$64–$120", "Comfortable for most; may want socks/sweater"],
    ["67°F (19.5°C)", "~10%", "$80–$150", "Slightly cool; sweater recommended"],
    ["66°F (18.8°C)", "~12%", "$96–$180", "Cool — noticeable for sedentary activities"],

/>

<Callout type="info">
**The 1–3% rule explained:** The DOE estimates that for every 1°F you lower the thermostat for 8 hours, you save approximately 1% on your heating bill. If you lower it for the full 24 hours, savings are closer to 3% per degree. The actual percentage depends on the temperature difference between inside and outside — savings are greater in mild climates and less in extreme cold because the heating load is proportionally larger.

    ["6:00 AM – 10:00 PM", "68°F", "Home all day — standard comfort"],
    ["10:00 PM – 6:00 AM", "62°F", "Sleeping — 6°F setback"],
  ]}
/>

**Estimated savings:** 6–8% vs. maintaining 68°F 24/7, or about $50–$120/year.

### Schedule 3: Family with Small Children

<ComparisonTable
  title="Family Winter Thermostat Schedule"
  headers={["Time", "Setting", "Reason"]}
  rows={[
    ["6:00 AM – 8:00 PM", "69–70°F", "Slightly warmer for children's comfort"],
    ["8:00 PM – 6:00 AM", "64–66°F", "Nighttime — moderate setback for kids' rooms"],
  ]}
/>

**Estimated savings:** 4–6% vs. maintaining 70°F 24/7. The pediatric recommendation is to keep sleeping areas between 65–70°F for infants and toddlers.

### Schedule 4: Maximum Savings

<ComparisonTable
  title="Maximum Savings Winter Schedule"
  headers={["Time", "Setting", "Reason"]}
  rows={[
    ["6:00 AM – 8:00 AM", "66°F", "Morning routine — sweater on"],
    ["8:00 AM – 5:00 PM", "58°F", "Away at work — deep setback"],
    ["5:00 PM – 10:00 PM", "66°F", "Evening at home — dress warmly"],
    ["10:00 PM – 6:00 AM", "58°F", "Sleeping under warm bedding"],
  ]}
/>

**Estimated savings:** 20–25% vs. maintaining 70°F 24/7, or about $160–$375/year. This schedule requires warm clothing indoors and quality bedding.

<Callout type="warning">
**Don't set the thermostat below 55°F when away for extended periods** (like vacations). Below 55°F, you risk frozen pipes — especially near exterior walls, in crawl spaces, or in poorly insulated areas. Pipe repairs from freezing can cost $1,000–$10,000+. The $10–$20 in heating costs to maintain 55°F during a week-long trip is cheap insurance.

## Smart Thermostats: Automated Savings

Smart thermostats (Ecobee, Google Nest, Honeywell T9) automate temperature schedules and learn your patterns. The typical energy savings from a smart thermostat:

    ["Amazon Smart Thermostat", "$60–$80", "~8%", "5–8% heating", "Alexa integration, budget"],
    ["Emerson Sensi Touch", "$120–$150", "Up to 10%", "6–9% heating", "Simple interface, wide compatibility"],
  ]}
  footnote="*Real-world savings depend on your previous thermostat behavior. If you already used a programmed schedule, savings from a smart thermostat are modest (3-5%). If you never programmed your old thermostat, savings can be 10-15%."
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**The biggest savings from a smart thermostat come from the geofencing feature** — the thermostat detects when you leave and automatically adjusts the temperature, then restores it when you return. If your schedule is irregular (varying work hours, travel), geofencing captures savings that a fixed schedule misses.
</Callout>

## Temperature and Health Considerations

Not everyone should follow the standard 68°F recommendation. Certain populations need warmer settings:

**Elderly adults (65+):** The WHO recommends indoor temperatures of at least 64°F (18°C) for healthy elderly adults and 70°F (21°C) for elderly adults who are frail, ill, or have limited mobility. Cold indoor temperatures increase the risk of hypothermia, cardiovascular events, and respiratory illness in older adults.

**Infants and toddlers:** The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends sleeping room temperatures of 68–72°F for infants. Overheating is a SIDS risk factor, so avoid going above 72°F — but below 65°F can cause discomfort and sleep disruption.

**People with chronic illness:** Conditions like Raynaud's disease, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease can be aggravated by cold indoor temperatures. Consult with your healthcare provider about appropriate indoor temperature ranges.

## Comfort Without Cranking the Heat

These strategies help you feel comfortable at lower thermostat settings:

**Use ceiling fans in reverse.** Set ceiling fans to clockwise rotation on low speed. This pushes warm air (pooled at the ceiling) back down to living level without creating a draft. You can feel 2–3°F warmer without touching the thermostat.

**Layer clothing.** A good sweater or fleece adds roughly 3–4°F of perceived warmth. Warm socks, slippers, and a base layer make 66°F feel like 70°F.

**Use heated blankets or mattress pads.** An electric blanket uses 50–200 watts — costing $0.01–$0.03 per hour — far less than heating your entire home an extra degree. Use it to maintain sleep comfort while setting back the thermostat.

**Cook and bake.** Using your oven adds free heat to your home. Opening the oven door after cooking (once it's off) lets residual heat warm the kitchen.

**Seal drafts.** Cold air infiltration near windows, doors, and outlets makes you feel colder than the room temperature suggests. Draft stoppers under doors ($5–$10), outlet insulation gaskets ($0.50 each), and window film kits ($10–$20 per window) are inexpensive and immediately noticeable.

## Real-World Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: The Chens — Simple Setback in Cleveland, OH**
The Chens had been keeping their thermostat at 72°F around the clock. Annual gas heating cost: $1,450. They programmed a simple schedule: 68°F when home, 62°F at night and when away. Their heating cost dropped to $1,220 — a savings of $230/year (16%). The adjustment took about a week to get used to, and they added a warm fleece blanket on the couch for evening TV time.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: The Nguyens — Smart Thermostat in Atlanta, GA**
The Nguyens installed a Google Nest thermostat ($230). With irregular schedules (one works from home, one commutes), the Nest's learning algorithm and geofencing automatically set back the temperature when no one was home. Annual savings: $145 on a $920 heating bill (16%). The Nest paid for itself in under 2 years.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: The O'Briens — Frozen Pipe Lesson in Burlington, VT**
The O'Briens set their thermostat to 50°F while on a 10-day vacation in January. A pipe in the exterior wall of their kitchen froze and burst, causing $6,500 in water damage. Their insurance covered most of it, but the deductible, hassle, and temporary displacement were significant. They now never set below 58°F when traveling — the extra $15–$20 in heating costs is trivial compared to the risk.
</Callout>

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **68°F when home, 60–62°F when sleeping or away** is the optimal balance of comfort and savings for most adults.
- **Every 1°F lower saves approximately 1–3%** on heating costs, depending on climate and setback duration.
- **A 7–10°F setback for 8 hours/day saves about 10%** — roughly $80–$200/year for a typical home.
- **Smart thermostats** save an additional 5–15% through automated scheduling and geofencing — the best ROI home upgrade under $250.
- **Never set below 55°F** when away to prevent frozen pipes. 58°F is a safer minimum in cold climates.
- **Elderly adults need at least 64–70°F** and infants need 68–72°F for health and safety.
- **Comfort strategies** (ceiling fans, warm clothing, heated blankets, draft sealing) let you feel comfortable at lower settings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What is the best temperature for a thermostat in winter?",
    answer: "The U.S. Department of Energy recommends 68°F (20°C) when you're home and awake. This balances comfort with energy savings for most adults. Lower it by 7-10°F when sleeping or away from home to save an additional 10% on heating costs. Adjust upward for elderly adults (70°F) and households with infants (68-72°F)."
  },
  {
    question: "What temperature should I set my thermostat to at night?",
    answer: "60-65°F is ideal for most healthy adults at night. Research shows sleep quality improves in cooler environments (60-67°F), and the energy savings from a 5-8°F nighttime setback are significant. Use warm bedding to compensate. For infants, keep the room at 68-72°F to balance comfort and SIDS risk reduction."
  },
  {
    question: "How much money does lowering the thermostat 1 degree save?",
    answer: "Approximately 1-3% of your heating bill per degree, depending on how long you maintain the lower setting. If your annual heating cost is $1,000, lowering the thermostat by 1°F saves $10-$30/year. A 5°F reduction for 8 hours daily saves about 5-8%, or $50-$80/year on a $1,000 heating bill."
  },
  {
    question: "Is 72°F too high for a thermostat in winter?",
    answer: "72°F isn't dangerous, but it's higher than most energy experts recommend. Compared to 68°F, maintaining 72°F costs about 8-12% more in heating. For a home with a $1,000 annual heating bill, that's $80-$120/year in extra costs. Most healthy adults adapt comfortably to 68°F within a few days, especially with a sweater."
  },
  {
    question: "What temperature should I set the thermostat when on vacation?",
    answer: "Set it to 55-60°F to prevent frozen pipes while minimizing energy waste. In very cold climates or homes with plumbing on exterior walls, 58-60°F is safer. Never set below 55°F in freezing climates — frozen pipe repairs can cost $1,000-$10,000+. Also open cabinet doors under sinks on exterior walls to allow warm air to reach pipes."
  },
  {
    question: "Does turning the heat down at night really save money?",
    answer: "Yes. The DOE estimates that setting back the thermostat 7-10°F for 8 hours (overnight) saves about 5-7% on heating costs. Combined with a daytime setback when you're at work, total savings reach 10-15%. A common myth is that the furnace uses more energy to reheat the house — in reality, the energy saved during the setback period exceeds the energy used during recovery."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to warm the house back up after a setback?",
    answer: "Most homes take 30-60 minutes to recover from a 6-8°F setback. A well-insulated home with a properly sized furnace recovers faster. Smart thermostats learn your home's recovery time and pre-heat accordingly — so the house reaches your target temperature exactly when you wake up or arrive home. Set your schedule to start warming 30-45 minutes before your arrival."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it cheaper to keep the house at a constant temperature?",
    answer: "No. This is one of the most persistent heating myths. The rate of heat loss from your home is proportional to the temperature difference between inside and outside. At a lower indoor temperature, the home loses heat more slowly, so the furnace runs less. The energy saved during the setback period is always greater than the energy needed to reheat. The DOE and multiple studies confirm this."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the healthiest temperature for a house?",
    answer: "The WHO recommends a minimum of 64°F (18°C) for healthy adults and 70°F (21°C) for vulnerable populations (elderly, ill, very young). Temperatures below 64°F can increase the risk of respiratory illness, cardiovascular events, and falls in elderly adults. Excessively warm temperatures (above 75°F) can cause dehydration and discomfort, and overly warm sleeping environments (above 72°F) impair sleep quality."
  },
  {
    question: "Do smart thermostats really save money?",
    answer: "Yes, typically 5-15% on heating costs — though the actual savings depend on your previous thermostat behavior. If you already programmed a schedule on a basic thermostat, a smart thermostat adds only 3-5% through optimization. If you never programmed your thermostat and maintained a constant temperature, savings can reach 10-15%. The biggest value comes from geofencing (automatic adjustments when you leave/return) and learning algorithms."
