# Cracked Heat Exchanger: 6 Symptoms & What to Do Next

A cracked heat exchanger is the most serious furnace problem you can face because it can leak carbon monoxide (CO) — an odorless, colorless gas responsible for 400+ deaths per year in the U.S. — directly into your home's air supply. If a technician has confirmed a crack, the furnace should be shut off and the heat exchanger replaced ($1,500–$3,500) or, more commonly, the entire furnace replaced ($3,500–$8,500) — especially if the furnace is over 15 years old.

Here are the 6 warning signs, how cracks are confirmed, what your options are, and how to protect your family.

<TableOfContents />

## What a Heat Exchanger Does (And Why Cracks Are Dangerous)

The heat exchanger is the metal barrier between the combustion gases (flame side) and the air you breathe (blower side). In a gas furnace, the burner fires inside the heat exchanger — a series of tubular or clamshell-shaped metal chambers. Air from your home's ductwork flows over the outside of these chambers, absorbing heat through the metal walls.

When the heat exchanger is intact, combustion byproducts (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, water vapor) stay sealed on the flame side and exit through the flue. When the exchanger cracks, those combustion gases can cross over into the air stream and be distributed through your ductwork to every room.

<Callout type="warning">
**Carbon monoxide is the primary danger.** CO is produced during normal gas combustion. Even a healthy furnace produces CO — it's safely vented through the flue. A cracked heat exchanger provides a path for CO to enter your living space. Low-level CO exposure causes headaches, nausea, and confusion. High-level exposure causes unconsciousness and death. Install CO detectors on every floor of your home and near sleeping areas — they are your last line of defense.

## The 6 Symptoms of a Cracked Heat Exchanger

<ComparisonTable
  title="Cracked Heat Exchanger Symptoms"
  headers={["Symptom", "What You'll Notice", "Other Possible Causes", "Severity"]}
  rows={[
    ["1. Yellow/flickering burner flame", "Flame is yellow, orange, or dances erratically instead of steady blue", "Dirty burners, gas pressure issue", "High — indicates incomplete combustion"],
    ["2. CO detector alarms", "CO detector sounds, especially during furnace operation", "Appliance venting issues, attached garage", "Critical — evacuate and call 911"],

  ]}
/>

### Symptom 1: Yellow or Flickering Burner Flame

A healthy gas furnace flame is steady and blue with a small yellow tip. If you look through the furnace sight glass and see a yellow, orange, or wildly flickering flame, the air-to-fuel ratio is off. A crack in the heat exchanger can disrupt combustion airflow patterns, pulling air through the crack and destabilizing the flame.

However, a yellow flame can also indicate dirty burners or incorrect gas pressure — so this symptom alone doesn't confirm a crack. It's a reason to schedule a professional inspection.

### Symptom 2: Carbon Monoxide Detector Alarms

If your CO detector sounds while the furnace is running, take it seriously every time. Do not assume it's a malfunction. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends evacuating immediately and calling 911.

After the home is cleared by firefighters with CO monitoring equipment, have an HVAC technician inspect the furnace before restarting it. CO alarms that coincide with furnace operation are among the strongest indicators of a cracked heat exchanger.

### Symptom 3: Headaches and Flu-Like Symptoms

Low-level CO exposure mimics flu symptoms — headaches, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. The key differentiator: symptoms improve when you leave the house and return when you come home. If multiple family members experience these symptoms simultaneously (especially during the heating season), consider CO exposure as a possible cause.

### Symptom 4: Soot or Black Residue

Visible soot inside the furnace cabinet, on or around the burners, or on nearby walls and ceiling indicates incomplete combustion. While dirty burners can produce soot, significant soot production in a furnace that was previously clean may signal a heat exchanger issue allowing flue gases to affect combustion airflow.

### Symptom 5: Unusual Chemical Smell

A cracked heat exchanger can allow combustion byproducts — including aldehydes and other partially combusted gases — to enter the air stream. You may notice a strong, chemical, or formaldehyde-like smell when the furnace runs. This is different from the brief "dusty" smell that occurs when a furnace first starts up for the season (which is normal and harmless).

### Symptom 6: Water Leaking From the Furnace

In condensing furnaces, the secondary heat exchanger is where condensation occurs. A crack in this exchanger can allow condensate to leak in unexpected locations. This symptom overlaps with other, more common causes of furnace water leaks (like a clogged condensate drain), but if the water appears to be coming from inside the heat exchanger area rather than the drain system, a crack is possible.

## How Heat Exchanger Cracks Are Confirmed

A cracked heat exchanger can only be confirmed through professional inspection. There are several methods technicians use:

**Visual inspection** is the most basic method. The technician removes the burner assembly to inspect the interior of the primary heat exchanger with a flashlight and mirror. Visible cracks, holes, or corrosion are definitive. However, small cracks (especially stress cracks in bends and weld joints) can be difficult to see visually.

**Camera inspection** uses a small flexible camera (borescope) inserted into the heat exchanger to inspect areas not visible to the naked eye. This is the most thorough inspection method and costs $100–$200 on top of a standard service call.

**Combustion analysis** measures CO levels in the supply air stream (the heated air going into your ducts). Elevated CO in the supply air indicates combustion gas crossover, which points to a heat exchanger breach. A combustion analyzer costs the technician $300–$1,000, which is why some budget shops skip this test.

<Callout type="important">
**Be cautious of the "spray test."** Some technicians use a chemical tracer or match flame held near the heat exchanger to look for drafting changes that suggest a crack. While these tests can detect large cracks, they often miss small stress cracks. A combustion analysis and/or camera inspection is far more reliable. If a technician diagnoses a cracked heat exchanger, ask what method they used to confirm it. If the diagnosis is based only on a visual inspection without a camera, consider getting a second opinion.

## What Causes Heat Exchangers to Crack?

<ComparisonTable
  title="Common Causes of Heat Exchanger Failure"
  headers={["Cause", "How It Happens", "Prevention"]}
  rows={[
    ["Age / thermal stress", "Repeated heating/cooling cycles expand and contract metal over 15–25 years", "None (normal wear); plan for replacement after 15–20 years"],
    ["Oversized furnace", "Oversized units short-cycle, causing rapid temp swings that stress metal", "Proper Manual J sizing at installation"],
    ["Restricted airflow", "Clogged filters or closed vents cause overheating", "Change filters regularly, keep all vents open"],
    ["Poor installation", "Incorrect gas pressure, improper venting, or mismatched components", "Use licensed HVAC contractors, verify permits"],
    ["Lack of maintenance", "Dirty burners cause hot spots; unchecked components degrade faster", "Annual professional tune-ups"],
    ["Manufacturing defect", "Rare but possible — usually caught within first 5 years", "Register warranty; watch for recalls"],
  ]}
/>

The #1 preventable cause is restricted airflow from clogged filters. When the filter is blocked, the heat exchanger can't dissipate heat fast enough — internal temperatures climb above design limits, the metal expands unevenly, and stress cracks develop over time.

## Repair vs. Replace: The Decision

<ComparisonTable
  title="Heat Exchanger Repair vs. Furnace Replacement"
  headers={["Factor", "Replace Heat Exchanger", "Replace Entire Furnace"]}

    ["Cost", "$1,500–$3,500", "$3,500–$8,500"],
    ["Labor time", "4–8 hours", "4–8 hours"],
    ["Warranty on new part", "Limited (often 1–5 years)", "Full manufacturer warranty (10–20 yr HX, 5–10 yr parts)"],

  ]}
/>

<Callout type="takeaway">
**The practical answer for most homeowners:** If your furnace is **under 10 years old** and the heat exchanger is covered under warranty (most manufacturers offer lifetime limited warranties on heat exchangers), repair it. You'll pay labor only ($500–$1,500).

If your furnace is **over 15 years old**, replace the entire unit. Spending $2,000–$3,500 on a heat exchanger for a furnace that may need a blower motor, control board, or gas valve replacement in the next few years is poor economics. A new 96% AFUE furnace at $5,000–$7,000 comes with full warranties, higher efficiency, and modern features.

If your furnace is **10–15 years old**, it's a judgment call. Get the repair quote, compare to replacement quotes, and consider the furnace's overall condition and your repair history.

## Real-World Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: The Martins — CO Detector Saved Lives in Pittsburgh, PA**
The Martins' 19-year-old Carrier furnace had been running fine until their CO detector sounded at 2 AM during a January cold snap. They evacuated and called 911. Firefighters measured 85 ppm CO in the home (50 ppm triggers health effects). An HVAC technician found a 3-inch crack in the primary heat exchanger at a weld joint. The furnace was immediately shut down. Given the age, the Martins replaced the entire unit with a 96% AFUE model for $5,800. The CO detector — a $30 device — likely prevented a tragedy.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: The Washingtons — Warranty Saved $2,400 in Indianapolis, IN**
The Washingtons' 7-year-old Goodman furnace developed a crack detected during a routine annual maintenance inspection. Because the furnace was registered and under the lifetime heat exchanger warranty, Goodman covered the full cost of the replacement exchanger. The Washingtons paid only $750 for the labor to install it. Without the warranty, the total cost would have been approximately $3,150.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: The Petersons — Misdiagnosis in Chicago, IL**
An HVAC company told the Petersons their 12-year-old Trane furnace had a cracked heat exchanger, quoting $6,500 for a full replacement. Suspicious, they got a second opinion from a technician who used a borescope camera. No crack was found — the yellow flame was caused by a dirty burner assembly. The burner cleaning cost $175. Lesson: always get a second opinion on a cracked heat exchanger diagnosis, especially if the technician didn't use a camera or combustion analyzer.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 4: The Kims — Oversized Furnace Failure in Milwaukee, WI**
The Kims' 100,000 BTU furnace in a 1,400 sq ft home was severely oversized (needed only about 55,000 BTU per a Manual J calculation). The constant short-cycling (2–3 minute run cycles) stressed the heat exchanger, which cracked at 14 years — younger than average. When they replaced it, they right-sized to a 60,000 BTU modulating furnace. The new unit runs longer, gentler cycles, and their home is more comfortable with lower energy bills.

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **A cracked heat exchanger is a safety emergency** — it can leak carbon monoxide into your home. If confirmed, shut off the furnace immediately.
- **The 6 warning signs** are: yellow/flickering flame, CO detector alarms, headache/flu symptoms, soot/residue, chemical smell, and unexplained water.
- **Confirmation requires professional inspection** — preferably with a borescope camera and/or combustion analysis. Visual-only inspections can miss small cracks.
- **Get a second opinion** if diagnosed with a cracked heat exchanger, especially if the technician's diagnosis seems rushed or was based on visual inspection alone.
- **Replace the entire furnace if it's over 15 years old.** Heat exchanger replacement alone ($1,500–$3,500) rarely makes economic sense when other components are also aging.
- **If the furnace is under warranty and under 10 years old**, repair is usually the right call — you'll pay only labor ($500–$1,500).
- **Install CO detectors on every floor** and test them monthly. They are your most important safety device when you have a gas furnace.
- **Prevent cracks** with regular filter changes, annual professional maintenance, and proper furnace sizing at installation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How dangerous is a cracked heat exchanger?",
    answer: "Very dangerous. A cracked heat exchanger can leak carbon monoxide into your home's air supply. CO is odorless and colorless — at high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death within minutes. At low concentrations, it causes chronic headaches, nausea, and confusion that may be mistaken for flu. If a crack is confirmed, the furnace should be shut off immediately until it's repaired or replaced."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you still use a furnace with a cracked heat exchanger?",
    answer: "No. Operating a furnace with a confirmed cracked heat exchanger puts your family at risk of carbon monoxide exposure. Shut the furnace off and use alternative heating (space heaters, fireplace) until the furnace is repaired or replaced. If you must temporarily use the furnace (to prevent pipe freezing, for example), ensure all CO detectors are working and keep the furnace operation to the absolute minimum."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to replace a heat exchanger?",
    answer: "Heat exchanger replacement costs $1,500–$3,500 including parts and labor. The part itself typically costs $500–$2,000 depending on the furnace brand and model. Labor runs $500–$1,500 for 4–8 hours of work. If the heat exchanger is under warranty, you pay only labor. However, for furnaces over 15 years old, replacing the entire furnace ($3,500–$8,500) is usually a better investment."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a heat exchanger last?",
    answer: "Heat exchangers typically last 15–25 years with proper maintenance. The average lifespan is 18–20 years. Factors that shorten lifespan include: oversized furnaces (short cycling stresses the metal), restricted airflow from dirty filters, lack of annual maintenance, and poor installation quality. Stainless steel heat exchangers (found in some high-end models) tend to last longer than standard aluminized steel."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a cracked heat exchanger be welded or repaired?",
    answer: "Technically, some cracks can be welded, but this is not recommended by any major manufacturer and no reputable HVAC company should offer it. Welded repairs on heat exchangers don't hold up to the repeated thermal stress cycles and will fail again. The proper repair is a complete heat exchanger replacement. Any technician who offers to weld a cracked heat exchanger should be avoided."
  },
  {
    question: "Do HVAC companies use cracked heat exchangers as a scare tactic?",
    answer: "Unfortunately, some unethical companies do diagnose cracked heat exchangers when no crack exists, particularly to upsell a full furnace replacement. This is why a second opinion is essential. A legitimate diagnosis should be based on a borescope camera inspection and/or combustion analysis — not just a visual glance. If the technician can't show you the crack (via camera images or photos), be skeptical."
  },
  {
    question: "Does homeowner's insurance cover a cracked heat exchanger?",
    answer: "Standard homeowner's insurance does not cover heat exchanger replacement because it's considered normal wear and tear, not sudden or accidental damage. However, a home warranty plan may cover it — check your plan's HVAC coverage terms. The furnace manufacturer's warranty typically covers the heat exchanger for 20 years to lifetime (when properly registered)."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should a heat exchanger be inspected?",
    answer: "The heat exchanger should be inspected annually as part of your regular fall furnace tune-up. This inspection is one of the most important reasons for annual professional maintenance. For furnaces over 15 years old, request a more thorough inspection with a combustion analysis (not just a visual check). The cost for a thorough inspection including combustion analysis is typically $150–$300."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the signs of carbon monoxide in my home?",
    answer: "Physical symptoms of CO exposure include: headaches, dizziness, nausea, confusion, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Environmental signs include: CO detector alarms, stale or stuffy air when the furnace runs, excessive moisture on windows, and soot around the furnace. The key indicator is that symptoms improve when you leave the house. If you suspect CO exposure, evacuate immediately and call 911."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a carbon monoxide detector detect a cracked heat exchanger?",
    answer: "A CO detector can alert you to carbon monoxide levels in your home, which may result from a cracked heat exchanger — but it's a last line of defense, not a diagnostic tool. Small cracks may produce CO levels below the detector's alarm threshold (typically 70 ppm sustained for 1–4 hours). Annual professional heat exchanger inspections with combustion analysis can detect problems before CO levels become dangerous."
