# Do Furnaces Have Pilot Lights? Which Ones Still Do (and Which Don't)

Most gas furnaces manufactured after 2010 do **not** have standing pilot lights — they use electronic ignition (hot surface igniter or direct spark) instead. Standing pilots are found mainly in furnaces from the 1970s through early 2000s. If your furnace has a PVC exhaust vent, a digital display, or was installed in the last 15 years, it almost certainly uses electronic ignition. If it has a metal flue pipe going straight up through the roof and a small visible flame burning continuously in the burner area, it has a standing pilot.

## The Three Types of Furnace Ignition

### 1. Standing Pilot Light (Oldest)

A small gas flame burns continuously (24/7) in the burner compartment. When the thermostat calls for heat, the gas valve opens, and the main burner lights from the always-burning pilot flame. A thermocouple (a temperature-sensing safety device) monitors the pilot — if the pilot goes out, the thermocouple cools and shuts the gas valve to prevent gas leaks.

**Found in:** Furnaces from the 1970s through early 2000s. Some gas fireplaces and water heaters still use this system.

**Pros:** Simple, reliable, no electricity needed to ignite.
**Cons:** Wastes $60–$110/year in gas, thermocouple failures are common.

### 2. Hot Surface Igniter (Most Common Today)

A silicon carbide or silicon nitride element heats up to 1,800–2,500°F when energized, glowing red-hot. The gas valve opens, and the gas ignites from contact with the glowing element. There's no standing flame — the igniter only activates during the ignition sequence.

**Found in:** The vast majority of modern furnaces (mid-2000s to present).

**Pros:** No gas wasted, reliable, automatic operation after power outages.
**Cons:** Igniters are fragile (last 3–7 years), replacement costs $150–$350.

### 3. Direct Spark Ignition (Less Common)

An electronic module generates a spark (similar to a gas grill igniter) that lights the gas directly. No standing flame, no glowing element.

**Found in:** Some commercial and residential furnaces, many gas boilers, and some gas fireplaces.

**Pros:** Durable, no glowing element to burn out.
**Cons:** Can be noisier at startup.

## What to Do If Your Pilot Light Goes Out

If your furnace has a standing pilot light and it goes out, here's how to relight it:

**Step 1: Turn the gas control to OFF.** Wait 5 minutes for any residual gas to dissipate. If you smell a strong gas odor, do NOT try to relight — leave the house and call your gas company.

**Step 2: Locate the pilot assembly.** Remove the access panel and find the pilot — a small tube near the main burner with a tiny nozzle. The thermocouple is a copper tube next to it.

**Step 3: Turn the gas control to PILOT.** Press and hold the knob or button down (this overrides the thermocouple safety to allow gas to flow to the pilot only).

**Step 4: Ignite the pilot.** Use a long lighter or the furnace's built-in piezo igniter (a button that creates a spark) to light the pilot while holding the button down.

**Step 5: Hold for 30–60 seconds.** This heats the thermocouple. If you release too early, the pilot will go out.

**Step 6: Release and turn to ON.** The pilot should stay lit. Turn the gas control from PILOT to ON. The furnace should now respond to thermostat calls.

<Callout type="warning">
**If the pilot won't stay lit after multiple attempts**, the thermocouple is likely bad. This is a common, inexpensive repair ($20–$40 part, $100–$200 with labor). A bad thermocouple fails to generate enough voltage to keep the gas valve open. Don't bypass the thermocouple — it's a critical safety device.

## Should You Upgrade From a Pilot Light Furnace?

If your furnace still uses a standing pilot light, it's almost certainly 20+ years old and operating at 65–80% AFUE. Upgrading to a modern furnace (96%+ AFUE with electronic ignition) delivers significant benefits:

**Energy savings:** 20–35% reduction in gas consumption (from efficiency improvement alone, not counting pilot elimination).

**Safety:** Modern furnaces have enhanced safety features — pressure switches, flame sensors, automatic lockout, and sealed combustion.

**Reliability:** Electronic ignition restarts automatically after power outages. No need to manually relight.

**Pilot light elimination:** Save an additional $60–$110/year in gas.

The payback period for replacing a standing-pilot furnace with a modern 96% unit is typically 4–8 years in cold climates.

## Real-World Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: The Kowalskis — Pilot Goes Out Every Windy Night (Buffalo, NY)**
Their 1990s furnace pilot blew out regularly on windy nights due to downdrafts through the chimney flue. The Kowalskis would wake up to a 55°F house and have to relight the pilot. After the third time in one winter, they replaced the furnace with a 96% AFUE sealed-combustion model ($5,800). No more pilot problems, and their heating bills dropped 30%.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: The Rodriguezes — Thermocouple Fix (San Antonio, TX)**
Their gas furnace's pilot light wouldn't stay lit — it would light but go out as soon as they released the button. The thermocouple was bad. A technician replaced it in 15 minutes for $145 (part + labor). The pilot stayed lit reliably afterward. Since the furnace was only 18 years old and in good condition otherwise, the repair made sense.

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **Most modern furnaces (post-2010) don't have pilot lights** — they use electronic ignition (hot surface igniter or direct spark).
- **Standing pilot lights** are found on furnaces from the 1970s–early 2000s and waste $60–$110/year in gas.
- **To identify your ignition type:** Look for a continuous small flame (pilot), check for a PILOT setting on the gas control knob, and note the vent pipe material (metal = likely pilot; PVC = electronic).
- **If your pilot goes out:** Turn gas to OFF, wait 5 minutes, then relight following the instructions on the furnace label.
- **If the pilot won't stay lit,** the thermocouple likely needs replacement — a $100–$200 repair.
- **A furnace with a standing pilot is 20+ years old** and a strong candidate for replacement. Modern furnaces save 20–35% on gas and eliminate pilot-related issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Do all gas furnaces have pilot lights?",
    answer: "No. Most gas furnaces manufactured after 2010 use electronic ignition (hot surface igniter or direct spark) instead of standing pilot lights. Standing pilots are found mainly in older furnaces from the 1970s through early 2000s. If you're unsure, look for a small continuous flame in the burner area — if there isn't one when the furnace is idle, you have electronic ignition."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my furnace has a pilot light?",
    answer: "Check three things: (1) Look through the furnace sight glass for a small, continuous flame when the furnace isn't actively heating. (2) Check the gas control knob — if it has a PILOT position, you have a standing pilot. (3) Check the vent pipe — PVC plastic vents indicate a modern condensing furnace with electronic ignition."
  },
  {
    question: "Why did my furnace pilot light go out?",
    answer: "The most common causes are: a draft blowing out the flame, a bad thermocouple that can't hold the gas valve open, a dirty pilot orifice, or a gas supply interruption. If the pilot won't stay lit after relighting, the thermocouple is the most likely culprit — it's a common, inexpensive repair ($100-$200)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I convert my furnace from pilot light to electronic ignition?",
    answer: "It's generally not practical or cost-effective. The conversion requires replacing the gas valve, control board, and ignition system — typically costing $500-$1,000+. Since furnaces with standing pilots are already 20+ years old, the money is better spent on a new furnace ($3,500-$8,500) with electronic ignition, higher efficiency, and modern safety features."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it safe to relight a furnace pilot?",
    answer: "Yes, if you follow proper procedures. Turn gas to OFF, wait 5 full minutes for residual gas to dissipate, then follow the relighting instructions on the furnace. Never attempt to relight if you smell a strong gas odor — leave the house and call your gas company. The relighting process is designed to be safe for homeowners to perform."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I leave my furnace pilot light on in summer?",
    answer: "There's no need to leave it on. A standing pilot costs $7-$9/month in gas for zero benefit during summer. Turn the gas control to OFF when you shut down the furnace for the season, and relight it in the fall. The only downside is the minor inconvenience of relighting, which takes about 5 minutes."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a thermocouple and how does it work?",
    answer: "A thermocouple is a safety device — a probe that sits in the pilot flame and generates a small electrical voltage (millivolts) when heated. This voltage holds the gas valve open. If the pilot goes out, the thermocouple cools, voltage drops to zero, and the gas valve closes automatically — preventing gas from flowing without a flame to ignite it. Thermocouples cost $10-$40 and have a lifespan of 5-10 years."
  },
  {
    question: "My pilot light is yellow instead of blue — is that a problem?",
    answer: "Yes. A healthy pilot flame should be primarily blue with a small yellow tip. A mostly yellow or orange pilot indicates incomplete combustion, which can produce elevated carbon monoxide. Causes include a dirty pilot orifice, insufficient air supply, or gas pressure issues. Have an HVAC technician adjust or clean the pilot assembly. Install CO detectors near the furnace as a safety measure."
