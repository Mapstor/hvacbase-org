# How Long Do Furnaces Last? (Lifespan by Type + 10 Replacement Signs)

A gas furnace lasts **15–25 years** with an average of 18–20 years. Electric furnaces last the longest at **20–30 years** (average 25) due to no combustion stress. Oil furnaces last **15–25 years** (average 18) but require diligent maintenance to reach the upper range. The component that typically determines end-of-life is the heat exchanger — once it cracks, the furnace is usually not worth repairing.

Here's how to estimate your furnace's remaining life, the 10 signs it needs replacing, and how to make the repair-vs-replace decision.

## 10 Signs Your Furnace Needs Replacing

1. **Age over 15–20 years.** Even if it's still running, a furnace past 15 years is living on borrowed time. Parts become harder to find, efficiency has degraded, and a major component failure is increasingly likely.

2. **Rising energy bills.** If your gas bills have increased 15–25% over the past few years despite stable rates and consistent thermostat settings, the furnace is losing efficiency due to internal wear.

3. **Frequent repairs.** If you've needed 3 or more repairs in the past 2 years, the system is in decline. Each repair patches one component while others continue aging.

4. **Yellow burner flame.** A healthy gas flame is blue. A yellow or orange flame indicates incomplete combustion, potentially from a degrading heat exchanger or burner assembly.

5. **Cracked heat exchanger.** This is the most definitive replacement signal. A cracked heat exchanger can leak carbon monoxide and costs $1,500–$3,500 to replace — often not worth it on an older furnace.

6. **Uneven heating.** If some rooms are too hot while others are cold, the furnace may be losing capacity, the blower may be weakening, or ductwork has degraded. While ductwork issues are separate, an aging furnace often contributes.

7. **Strange noises.** Banging, squealing, rattling, or popping sounds that weren't present before indicate worn components — bearings, belts, heat exchanger expansion, or loose parts.

8. **Excessive dust.** An aging furnace with failing seals and worn components can pull more dust into the system and distribute it through the house.

9. **Thermostat adjustments don't help.** If you keep raising the thermostat but the house still feels cold, the furnace is losing heating capacity.

10. **Carbon monoxide detector alarms.** Any CO alarm during furnace operation demands immediate inspection. On an older furnace, this often indicates a cracked heat exchanger warranting replacement.

## The Repair vs. Replace Decision

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Three decision rules:**

**50% Rule:** If the repair costs more than 50% of a new furnace AND the furnace is over 15 years old, replace it.

**$5,000 Rule:** Multiply age × repair cost. If the result exceeds $5,000, replace it. (Example: 16 years × $350 repair = $5,600 → replace.)

**3-Repair Rule:** If you've had 3+ repairs in 2 years, the system is in overall decline. Further repairs are postponing the inevitable.

## Real-World Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: The Martins — 24-Year-Old Carrier Still Running (Cleveland, OH)**
Their 1992 Carrier 80% AFUE furnace was still operational at 24 years with annual maintenance. However, gas bills had risen 30% over 5 years, parts were getting hard to source, and the technician noted early corrosion in the heat exchanger. They replaced it proactively with a 96% AFUE unit, saving $450/year in gas immediately. They avoided the risk of a mid-winter emergency replacement at premium prices.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: The Reyes Family — Smart Repair at Year 8 (Phoenix, AZ)**
Their 8-year-old Goodman furnace needed a $450 blower motor replacement. Age × cost = 8 × $450 = $3,600 (under $5,000). The furnace was in otherwise great condition with a lifetime heat exchanger warranty. The repair made sense and the furnace has run fine for 3 more years since.

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **Gas furnaces:** 15–25 years (avg 18–20). **Electric:** 20–30 years (avg 25). **Oil:** 15–25 years (avg 18).
- **Annual maintenance and regular filter changes** are the two most impactful things you can do to extend furnace life.
- **Proper sizing at installation** prevents short cycling, which is one of the top lifespan-shortening factors.
- **Start budgeting for replacement at year 15** — even if the furnace is still running.
- Use the **50% rule, $5,000 rule, and 3-repair rule** for objective repair-vs-replace decisions.
- **A cracked heat exchanger on a 15+ year furnace** is almost always a replace signal.
- **Proactive replacement** in the off-season saves money versus emergency replacement in January.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How long does a gas furnace last?",
    answer: "A gas furnace typically lasts 15-25 years, with an average of 18-20 years. High-efficiency condensing models (90%+ AFUE) can last slightly longer than standard-efficiency models because they're typically built with better components. Regular annual maintenance and consistent filter changes can push a furnace toward the upper end of this range."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I replace my furnace?",
    answer: "Consider replacement when: (1) the furnace is over 15-20 years old, (2) you've had 3+ repairs in 2 years, (3) energy bills have risen significantly despite stable rates, (4) the heat exchanger is cracked, or (5) a single repair exceeds 50% of a new furnace's cost. Don't wait for a complete failure — plan ahead and schedule replacement during the off-season for the best pricing."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a furnace last 30 years?",
    answer: "Gas and oil furnaces rarely last 30 years — the heat exchanger and other combustion components deteriorate with thermal cycling. Electric furnaces can reach 30 years because they lack combustion stress. If your gas furnace is over 25 years old and still running, it's a testament to good maintenance — but it's operating well below its original efficiency and replacement should be imminent."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find the age of my furnace?",
    answer: "Check the furnace rating plate (inside the access panel) for the model number and serial number. Most manufacturers encode the manufacture date in the serial number — the first 2-4 digits often represent the year and week of manufacture. You can also search the model number online or contact the manufacturer's customer service for the exact manufacture date."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a furnace lose efficiency with age?",
    answer: "Yes. A furnace's actual operating efficiency degrades over time due to: soot and scale buildup in the heat exchanger, worn burner components affecting combustion quality, air leaks developing in the cabinet and ductwork connections, and general wear on the blower motor. A 20-year-old furnace rated at 80% AFUE may actually operate at 70-75% in practice."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I replace my furnace before it dies?",
    answer: "Yes, for three reasons: (1) You can shop around and compare quotes without the pressure of an emergency. (2) Off-season installation (spring/fall) is 10-15% cheaper than winter emergency replacement. (3) You avoid the risk of frozen pipes and the discomfort of being without heat while waiting for an emergency installation."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to replace a furnace in 2026?",
    answer: "National averages: gas furnace $5,500 installed ($3,500-$8,500 range), electric furnace $3,500 installed ($2,000-$5,500 range), oil furnace $7,200 installed ($5,000-$10,000 range). The biggest cost variables are efficiency rating, brand, and local labor rates."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a newer furnace save money?",
    answer: "Yes, significantly if you're replacing an old, low-efficiency unit. Upgrading from 80% to 96% AFUE saves about 17% on gas costs — roughly $150-$400/year depending on climate. A modulating furnace also saves on electricity (variable-speed blower) and provides more consistent comfort. Payback period on the efficiency upgrade alone: typically 5-12 years."
