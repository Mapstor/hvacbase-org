# Gas vs Electric Heating: Which Is Cheaper? (2026 Cost Calculator)

Gas heating costs roughly 50–60% less than electric resistance heating for the average American home in 2026. At current national average fuel prices — $1.05 per therm for natural gas and $0.16 per kWh for electricity — a 2,000 sq ft home in a moderate climate spends about $850/year on gas heat versus $1,800/year on electric heat. The gap narrows only in regions with unusually cheap electricity (under $0.10/kWh) or expensive gas (over $1.60/therm).

However, the full picture is more nuanced. Upfront costs, maintenance, equipment lifespan, and — increasingly — heat pump technology all affect the real total cost of ownership. Here's the complete data-driven comparison.

<TableOfContents />

## The Cost-Per-BTU Calculation

Heating fuel costs are most accurately compared by calculating the cost to produce one million BTUs (MMBtu) of useful heat — the heat that actually warms your home after accounting for furnace efficiency.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Cost Per Million BTU of Delivered Heat — 2026 National Averages"
  headers={["Fuel", "Unit Price", "BTU per Unit", "Furnace Efficiency", "Cost per MMBtu (Delivered)"]}

<Callout type="important">
**The critical takeaway from this table:** Natural gas heat costs $10–$13 per million BTU. Electric resistance heat costs $47 per million BTU — roughly **3.5–4.3× more expensive**. This is the fundamental reason gas heating dominates in most of the U.S. The only electric technology that approaches gas cost-effectiveness is the heat pump, which multiplies electricity's heating value by 2–3× through heat transfer rather than direct resistance heating.

<Callout type="info">
**Where electric heating can be competitive with gas:**
- **Washington and Oregon** — cheap hydroelectric power ($0.10–$0.11/kWh) and moderate winter climates narrow the gap significantly.
- **Anywhere with a heat pump** — at COP 2.5, a heat pump at $0.16/kWh costs only $18.75/MMBtu, much closer to gas at $10.94/MMBtu.
- **Areas without gas service** — if running a gas line costs $5,000–$15,000, the economics shift in favor of electric (especially heat pumps).

## Total Cost of Ownership: 15-Year Analysis

Annual fuel cost is only part of the equation. You need to account for equipment cost, installation, maintenance, and lifespan.

<ComparisonTable

  ]}
  footnote="Assumes national average fuel prices remain stable (inflation-adjusted). Gas furnace total includes separate AC system cost."
/>

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Over 15 years, a gas furnace system (with separate AC) costs approximately $25,000 — about $40,000 less than electric resistance heating.** A heat pump system falls in between at roughly $44,500, but provides both heating and cooling in a single system. In mild climates where cooling costs dominate, the heat pump often wins on total cost.
</Callout>

## When Electric Heating Makes More Sense Than Gas

Despite gas's clear cost advantage on fuel alone, there are legitimate scenarios where electric heating is the smarter choice:

**No gas line available.** Running a new gas line from the street to your home costs $2,000–$15,000+ depending on distance and terrain. In rural areas, it may not be available at all. If you'd need to install gas infrastructure, the upfront cost erases years of fuel savings.

**Mild climate with low heating loads.** In a home that needs only $400–$600/year in heating (like in the Southeast or Southern California), the difference between gas and electric might be $200–$400/year — not enough to justify gas line costs and annual furnace maintenance.

**Heat pump territory.** In climates where winter temperatures rarely drop below 25–30°F, a heat pump provides both heating and cooling at 200–300% efficiency. This brings electric heating costs close to gas while eliminating the need for a separate AC system.

**New construction efficiency.** Highly insulated new construction (R-49 attic, R-21 walls, triple-pane windows, tight air sealing) may need so little heat that the fuel type matters less. Some passive-house-level builds heat effectively with just a mini-split heat pump.

**Renewable energy goals.** If you have rooftop solar, electric heating can be partially or fully offset by self-generated electricity, making the effective operating cost near zero during sunny months. Gas can never be self-generated at the residential level.

## Real-World Comparison Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: The Hendersons — Cleveland, OH (Cold Climate)**
Home: 2,100 sq ft colonial, built 1978, moderately insulated.
Gas rate: $0.90/therm. Electric rate: $0.14/kWh.
Annual gas heating cost (96% AFUE): $920.
Projected electric resistance cost: $3,700.
Annual savings with gas: **$2,780/year**.
Verdict: Gas wins decisively. At this savings rate, even a $10,000 gas furnace installation pays for itself in under 4 years compared to electric resistance.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: The Nguyens — Portland, OR (Mild Climate)**
Home: 1,600 sq ft ranch, built 2018, well-insulated.
Gas rate: $1.05/therm. Electric rate: $0.10/kWh.
Annual gas heating cost (96% AFUE): $440.
Projected electric resistance cost: $780.
Projected heat pump cost (COP 2.8): $280.
Annual savings with gas over electric resistance: **$340/year**.
Annual savings with heat pump over gas: **$160/year**.
Verdict: A heat pump is actually the cheapest option here, thanks to cheap electricity and a mild climate. Gas makes sense only if you already have the infrastructure. Electric resistance is the worst option but the gap is much smaller than in cold climates.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: The Morales Family — Houston, TX (Mild Climate)**
Home: 2,400 sq ft, built 2005.
Gas rate: $0.95/therm. Electric rate: $0.13/kWh.
Annual gas heating cost (96% AFUE): $380.
Projected electric resistance cost: $850.
Annual savings with gas: **$470/year**.
Verdict: Gas saves money but the total amounts are small because Houston's heating season is short. The Morales family's cooling bill ($1,500+/year) dwarfs their heating bill. A heat pump system that handles both would be the most cost-effective overall solution.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 4: The Johnsons — Rural Vermont (Very Cold Climate, No Gas)**
Home: 1,800 sq ft farmhouse, moderately insulated.
No natural gas line available (nearest gas main: 2 miles).
Propane rate: $2.75/gallon. Electric rate: $0.20/kWh.
Annual propane heating cost: $3,200.
Projected electric resistance cost: $4,700.
Projected heat pump + electric backup cost: $2,400.
Verdict: Without natural gas, the comparison shifts dramatically. A cold-climate heat pump with electric backup is actually the cheapest option, beating even propane. Electric resistance remains the most expensive option.
</Callout>

## The Heat Pump Factor: Changing the Equation

Heat pumps are increasingly disrupting the gas vs. electric debate. Modern cold-climate heat pumps (like the Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat or Bosch IDS 2.0) can operate efficiently down to -15°F, which means they're now viable even in northern climates that previously required gas furnaces.

The key metric is COP (Coefficient of Performance) — a heat pump with COP 3.0 delivers 3 units of heat for every 1 unit of electricity consumed, effectively tripling the efficiency of electric resistance heating. At a COP of 3.0:

- Electric resistance at $0.16/kWh → **$46.88/MMBtu**
- Heat pump at $0.16/kWh with COP 3.0 → **$15.63/MMBtu**
- Gas at $1.05/therm, 96% AFUE → **$10.94/MMBtu**

At COP 3.0, a heat pump still costs about 43% more per BTU than gas at national average prices. But in areas with cheap electricity or expensive gas, the heat pump can actually beat gas on operating cost.

<Callout type="tip">
**The crossover points:** A heat pump with COP 2.5 breaks even with a 96% gas furnace when gas costs more than $1.60/therm and electricity is at the national average of $0.16/kWh — or when electricity costs less than $0.07/kWh with gas at the national average of $1.05/therm. These crossover points shift with climate severity, making heat pumps increasingly attractive in mild and moderate climates.

## Environmental Comparison

Beyond cost, carbon emissions are an increasingly important factor:

  headers={["Heating Source", "CO2 per MMBtu (Delivered)", "Annual CO2 (2,000 sq ft home)", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Natural Gas (96% AFUE)", "123 lbs", "9,840 lbs", "Direct combustion emissions"],
    ["Electric Resistance (grid avg)", "159 lbs", "12,720 lbs", "Depends heavily on grid mix"],
    ["Heat Pump COP 2.5 (grid avg)", "64 lbs", "5,120 lbs", "Most efficient on average grid"],
    ["Heat Pump COP 2.5 (clean grid)", "~10 lbs", "~800 lbs", "WA, OR, VT — mostly hydro/nuclear"],
    ["Heating Oil (85% AFUE)", "188 lbs", "15,040 lbs", "Highest carbon option"],
  ]}
  footnote="Based on EPA eGRID 2024 average U.S. grid emission factor of 0.367 kg CO2/kWh. Clean grid states have emissions factors under 0.1 kg CO2/kWh."
/>

In states with clean electricity grids (Washington, Oregon, Vermont, California), heat pumps produce dramatically less carbon than gas furnaces. Even in coal-heavy grid states, heat pumps at COP 2.5+ produce less CO2 than gas.

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **Gas heating costs 50–60% less than electric resistance heating** at national average fuel prices — about $875/year vs. $1,800–$3,750/year for a typical home.
- **Electric resistance heating is the most expensive option** in almost every scenario. It makes sense only in mild climates, homes without gas access, or as backup in a heat pump system.
- **Heat pumps change the calculus.** At COP 2.5+, they bring electric heating costs within 40–70% of gas. In mild climates with cheap electricity, heat pumps can actually beat gas on operating cost.
- **Location matters enormously.** The gas advantage ranges from 53% savings in Washington (cheap electricity) to 81% savings in Colorado (cheap gas, moderate electricity).
- **Total cost of ownership favors gas** over electric resistance by about $40,000 over 15 years for a typical home. Heat pump systems fall in between and offer the bonus of efficient cooling.
- **The best choice depends on**: local fuel prices, climate severity, gas line availability, and whether you also need air conditioning.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Is gas or electric heat cheaper in 2026?",
    answer: "Gas heat is significantly cheaper in almost every U.S. market. At national average prices ($1.05/therm gas, $0.16/kWh electricity), gas costs about $10.94 per million BTU delivered versus $46.88 for electric resistance — making electric roughly 4.3× more expensive per unit of heat. A typical 2,000 sq ft home saves $900–$2,800/year with gas over electric resistance, depending on climate."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to heat a house with electricity per month?",
    answer: "In a moderate-to-cold climate (like the Midwest or Northeast), electric resistance heating for a 2,000 sq ft home costs $250–$550 per month during winter months at the national average rate of $0.16/kWh. In mild climates (Southeast, Southwest), expect $75–$175 per month. A heat pump reduces these costs by 50–65%."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth switching from electric to gas heat?",
    answer: "If natural gas is already available at your home, switching from electric resistance to gas typically saves $1,000–$3,000/year and pays back the conversion cost ($4,000–$7,000) in 2–5 years. If gas isn't available, the line installation cost ($2,000–$15,000+) may extend the payback to 5–10+ years. Consider a heat pump as an alternative — it can reduce electric heating costs by 50–65% without needing a gas line."
  },
  {
    question: "Where is electric heat cheaper than gas?",
    answer: "Electric resistance heat is rarely cheaper than gas in any U.S. market. The only scenario where it comes close is in the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon) where electricity is very cheap ($0.08–$0.10/kWh) from hydropower. Even there, gas is usually still cheaper per BTU. However, heat pumps with COP 2.5+ can beat gas on operating cost in mild climates with electricity under $0.12/kWh."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does gas heat cost per month?",
    answer: "Gas heating for a 2,000 sq ft home typically costs $80–$200 per month during winter in moderate-to-cold climates, using a 96% AFUE furnace at national average gas prices. In very cold climates (Minnesota, Wisconsin), expect $150–$250/month in the coldest months. Annual totals typically range from $600 to $1,200."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a heat pump cheaper than gas in 2026?",
    answer: "It depends on your location. At national average prices, gas still costs about 40% less per BTU than a heat pump (COP 2.5). But in areas with cheap electricity (under $0.12/kWh) and moderate winters, heat pumps can match or beat gas. The biggest heat pump advantage is combined heating AND cooling — eliminating the need for a separate AC unit. In mild climates, this total system savings often makes heat pumps the best overall value."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cheapest way to heat a house?",
    answer: "For most American homes, natural gas with a 96% AFUE furnace is the cheapest heating fuel. The cheapest SYSTEM (heating + cooling combined) is often a heat pump in mild-to-moderate climates. The cheapest overall approach combines efficient equipment with building envelope improvements — insulating, air sealing, and upgrading windows can reduce heating loads by 25–50%, making any fuel source cheaper."
  },
  {
    question: "Does electric heat dry out the air more than gas?",
    answer: "Not significantly. Both gas and electric forced-air furnaces reduce relative humidity because they heat air without adding moisture. Gas furnaces are often blamed more for dry air because they tend to heat to higher supply air temperatures (120–140°F vs. 90–120°F for electric), but the primary driver of winter dryness is cold outside air with low absolute humidity infiltrating the home. A whole-house humidifier ($300–$800 installed) solves this regardless of fuel type."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find my local gas and electricity rates?",
    answer: "Check your most recent utility bills — your gas rate appears as cost per therm (or per CCF, which equals 1.024 therms) and your electricity rate appears as cost per kWh. You can also find average rates by state on the U.S. EIA website (eia.gov). Look for the 'delivery' or 'total' rate, not just the 'supply' charge, since both components contribute to your actual cost."
  },
  {
    question: "Will gas prices go up or down in the future?",
    answer: "Natural gas prices are notoriously difficult to predict. U.S. prices have been relatively stable in the $0.80–$1.20/therm range for residential customers over the past decade, supported by abundant domestic shale gas production. However, increased LNG exports, extreme weather events, and production changes can cause volatility. Electricity prices have risen more steadily (about 2–3% per year). Most energy analysts expect both fuels to see modest increases, keeping the gas cost advantage roughly stable through the late 2020s."
