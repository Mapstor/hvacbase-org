2. **Normal operations:** Run HVAC system in typical mode
3. **Avoid interference:** No painting, heavy cleaning, or pesticides
4. **Document conditions:** Note recent renovations, water damage, chemical use
5. **Multiple locations:** Test bedrooms, living areas, basement, near HVAC

### Sampling Methodology

| Pollutant | Sampling Duration | Height | Location | Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Radon | 48 hours minimum | 3-6 feet | Lowest lived-in level | Closed conditions |
| VOCs | 24 hours ideal | 3-5 feet | Center of room | Normal ventilation |
| Particles | 1-hour intervals | 3-5 feet | Away from sources | Document activities |
| CO₂ | Continuous | 3-5 feet | Breathing zone | Occupied periods |
| Mold | 5-10 minutes | Various | Problem areas | Normal conditions |

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How accurate are consumer IAQ monitors under $200?",
    answer: "Consumer monitors under $200 typically have accuracy of ±15-20% for particles, ±50 ppm for CO₂, and qualitative-only VOC readings. They're excellent for trend detection and relative changes but shouldn't replace professional testing for health decisions. The Airthings Wave Plus ($229) and Temtop M2000 ($169) offer the best accuracy in this range. For medical or legal purposes, use NIST-traceable professional equipment or laboratory analysis."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between VOC, TVOC, and specific VOC testing?",
    answer: "TVOC (Total VOCs) gives a combined reading of all volatile organic compounds in ppb or μg/m³ — useful for general screening but doesn't identify specific chemicals. Individual VOC testing (like TO-15 lab analysis) identifies and quantifies 70+ specific compounds like benzene, formaldehyde, and toluene. Consumer monitors measure TVOC only. Professional PID sensors are more accurate for TVOC. Lab testing ($300) is required to identify specific VOCs and their sources."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I test for mold even without visible growth?",
    answer: "Yes, if you have: persistent musty odors, unexplained allergic symptoms, history of water damage, or humidity regularly above 60%. Hidden mold often grows in wall cavities, under carpets, or in HVAC systems. Air sampling ($150) detects airborne spores, while surface testing confirms growth locations. However, if you see or smell mold, skip testing and proceed directly to remediation — testing just delays necessary cleanup."
  },
  {
    question: "How long should I run an air quality test?",
    answer: "Depends on the pollutant: Radon requires 48-hour minimum (ideally 90 days for accuracy). VOCs need 24 hours to capture daily cycles. Particles should be monitored continuously for a week to identify patterns. CO₂ needs testing during peak occupancy periods. Formaldehyde badges typically run 5-7 days. For comprehensive assessment, monitor for 7 days including a weekend to capture different activity patterns."
  },
  {
    question: "What pollutants do standard home inspections miss?",
    answer: "Standard home inspections typically miss: radon (requires 48+ hour testing), VOCs (need specialized equipment), formaldehyde (separate testing required), accurate mold assessment (visual only), electromagnetic fields (EMF), pesticide residues, and lead dust. Home inspectors may note visible issues but rarely conduct actual air sampling. Budget $500-1,500 for comprehensive IAQ testing beyond standard inspection."
  },
  {
    question: "Can houseplants really improve indoor air quality?",
    answer: "NASA's 1989 study showing plants remove VOCs used sealed chambers with concentrated pollutants — not realistic home conditions. You'd need 680 plants in a 1,500 sq ft home to match one air purifier. Plants contribute negligible pollutant removal at typical densities (1-2 per room). However, they may provide psychological benefits and humidity regulation. For measurable IAQ improvement, focus on source control, ventilation, and mechanical filtration instead."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do CO₂ levels matter if CO₂ itself isn't toxic at indoor levels?",
    answer: "CO₂ is a proxy for ventilation adequacy. Levels above 1,000 ppm indicate insufficient fresh air, allowing buildup of other pollutants (VOCs, bioeffluents, viruses). Studies show cognitive function declines 15% at 950 ppm, 50% at 1,400 ppm. High CO₂ also indicates energy waste from over-ventilation or opportunity for energy recovery ventilation. ASHRAE 62.1 recommends maintaining below 700 ppm above outdoor levels (typically 1,100 ppm absolute)."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the fastest way to improve IAQ during wildfire smoke events?",
    answer: "1) Seal air leaks with tape/towels, 2) Set HVAC to recirculate mode (no fresh air), 3) Install MERV 13+ filter or tape MERV 13 material over existing filter, 4) Run portable HEPA purifiers on high in occupied rooms, 5) Create a clean room with box fan + MERV 13 filter, 6) Avoid cooking, vacuuming, or burning candles. Professional tip: N95 masks indoors if AQI exceeds 200. Most homes see 50-70% reduction in PM2.5 with these steps."
