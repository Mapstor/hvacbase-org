# HVAC Rebates by State: Find Local Incentives for Heat Pumps, AC & Furnaces (2026)

**Your state is now your best source for HVAC savings.** With federal tax credits (25C and 25D) terminated as of December 31, 2026, state-administered rebate programs and utility incentives are the primary financial tools for reducing HVAC upgrade costs in 2026. Depending on your state, income level, and utility provider, you could save $2,000 to $14,000+ on a new heat pump system — in some cases more than the old federal credits offered.

This guide covers the two major IRA-funded state programs (HOMES and HEAR), state-by-state rollout status, and how to find every utility rebate in your area.

<TableOfContents />

## Understanding the Two Major State Rebate Programs

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocated $8.8 billion for two residential rebate programs. Unlike the expired federal tax credits, these are administered by individual states, which means eligibility rules, rebate amounts, and application processes vary.

### HOMES: Home Energy Performance-Based, Whole-House Rebates

**Federal allocation:** $4.3 billion across all states and territories.

HOMES incentivizes comprehensive energy retrofits — not single equipment swaps. Your rebate amount is based on the percentage of energy savings your project achieves.

| Energy Savings | Any Income | ≤80% AMI | Multifamily (per unit) |
|---------------|------------|----------|----------------------|
| 20–34% reduction | Up to $2,000 | Up to $4,000 | Up to $2,000 (or $4,000 LMI) |
| 35%+ reduction | Up to $4,000 | Up to $8,000 | Up to $4,000 (or $8,000 LMI) |

HOMES requires either modeled energy savings (using DOE-approved software before installation) or measured energy savings (based on actual utility data after installation). This means you'll typically need a home energy assessment as part of the process.

### HEAR: Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates

**Federal allocation:** $4.5 billion across all states and territories.

HEAR provides point-of-sale rebates for individual electric appliances and upgrades. It's income-restricted and focused on electrification.

| Equipment | ≤80% AMI | 80–150% AMI |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Heat pump (HVAC) | $8,000 | $4,000 |
| Heat pump water heater | $1,750 | $1,750 |
| Electric stove/cooktop | $840 | $840 |
| HP clothes dryer | $840 | $840 |
| Insulation & air sealing | $1,600 | $1,600 |
| Electrical panel upgrade | $4,000 | $2,000 |
| Electrical wiring | $2,500 | $1,250 |
| **Max per household** | **$14,000** | **Varies (~$7,000+)** |

<Callout type="important">
**Income qualification is based on Area Median Income (AMI)** for your county, not statewide averages. A family of 4 earning $60,000 might qualify as ≤80% AMI in one county but 80–150% AMI in another. Look up your county's AMI using the HUD Income Limits dataset at huduser.gov.

## How to Stack Incentives for Maximum Savings

The best savings come from combining multiple incentive sources. Here's the general stacking hierarchy:

| Layer | Source | Typical Amount | Income Restricted? |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | HEAR or HOMES (state-administered) | $2,000–$14,000 | HEAR: Yes (≤150% AMI). HOMES: Partially |
| 2 | Utility rebate | $200–$2,500 | Usually no |
| 3 | Manufacturer promotion | $200–$1,500 | No |
| 4 | Local/municipal incentive | $200–$1,000 | Varies |
| **Potential total** | | **$2,600–$19,000** | |

### Stacking Rules

**Can stack:** HEAR + utility rebate + manufacturer promotion is generally allowed. HOMES + utility rebate + manufacturer promotion is generally allowed.

**Cannot stack:** HOMES + HEAR on the same project. Total incentives cannot exceed total project cost.

**Must check:** Individual program terms. Some utilities reduce their rebate amount when state rebates are also applied. Some states have specific anti-double-dipping rules.

### Real-World Example: Maximum Stack in Massachusetts

**Mike and Amy in Worcester, MA** (household income $52,000, family of 4 — qualifies as ≤80% AMI for Worcester County). Installing a cold-climate heat pump system at $13,500 total cost:

| Incentive | Source | Amount |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| HEAR rebate (≤80% AMI) | MassCEC | $8,000 |
| Mass Save heat pump rebate | Utility program | $2,500 |
| Manufacturer rebate | Mitsubishi seasonal | $500 |
| **Total incentives** | | **$11,000** |
| **Out-of-pocket cost** | | **$2,500** |

They're paying just 18.5% of the total project cost out of pocket. In some scenarios, the total incentives cover 100% of project costs for low-income households.

### Real-World Example: No State Program Available

**Angela in Houston, TX** (household income $95,000). Texas hasn't launched HOMES or HEAR yet. She's limited to utility incentives:

| Incentive | Source | Amount |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| CenterPoint Energy rebate | Utility | $300 |
| Trane Cool Cash promotion | Manufacturer | $1,200 |
| **Total incentives** | | **$1,500** |
| Heat pump installed cost | | $10,800 |
| **Out-of-pocket cost** | | **$9,300** |

Angela pays 86% out of pocket. Once Texas launches its programs, future homeowners in her position will have access to significantly more savings.

### Real-World Example: Rural Electric Cooperative

**James in rural Iowa** (household income $48,000, family of 3). His electric cooperative offers its own generous heat pump rebate, plus Iowa is rolling out HEAR:

| Incentive | Source | Amount |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| HEAR rebate (≤80% AMI) | Iowa state program | $8,000 |
| Corn Belt Power Cooperative rebate | Utility | $1,800 |
| **Total incentives** | | **$9,800** |
| Geothermal heat pump installed cost | | $22,000 |
| **Out-of-pocket cost** | | **$12,200** |

Rural electric cooperatives often offer some of the most generous utility-level rebates because they benefit from reduced peak demand and wholesale power cost savings when members install efficient equipment.

## Step-by-Step: How to Find and Claim Your Rebates

### Step 1: Determine Your Income Eligibility

Look up your county's AMI (Area Median Income) at HUD's income limits website. Then calculate where your household falls:

| Household Size | Approximate 80% AMI (National Average) | Approximate 150% AMI (National Average) |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 person | $43,000 | $81,000 |
| 2 people | $49,200 | $92,200 |
| 3 people | $55,350 | $103,800 |
| 4 people | $61,500 | $115,300 |

These are national averages. Your county's AMI varies significantly — San Francisco's is much higher than rural Mississippi's. Always check the HUD dataset for your specific county.

### Step 2: Check Your State Energy Office

Visit your state's energy office website. Search for "home energy rebates," "HEAR program," or "HOMES program." Most state energy offices maintain dedicated pages for IRA-funded rebate programs.

### Step 3: Check the DSIRE Database

Visit dsireusa.org and enter your zip code. DSIRE catalogs every state, utility, and local incentive program in the country, updated regularly.

### Step 4: Contact Your Utility Company

Call your electric and gas utility's customer service line or visit their website. Ask specifically about:
- Heat pump rebates (both air-source and ground-source)
- High-efficiency AC rebates
- Furnace/boiler rebates
- Weatherization rebates (insulation, air sealing)
- Smart thermostat rebates
- Low-income assistance programs

### Step 5: Get Contractor Quotes with Rebate Breakdowns

Ask at least 3 HVAC contractors for quotes that include a written breakdown of all applicable rebates. Good contractors are up to date on every available program and can help you navigate applications.

### Step 6: Apply Before You Install

For HEAR programs, most states require income verification and rebate reservation before work begins. For utility rebates, some require pre-approval while others accept post-installation applications. Confirm the sequence with each program.

<Callout type="warning">
**First-come, first-served funding.** California's HEAR program for Central and Southern California was fully reserved within months of launching. When your state's program opens, apply immediately. Once the federal allocation is exhausted, there's no guaranteed additional funding.
</Callout>

## Programs to Watch in 2026 and Beyond

### Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) Grant

DRCOG received a $200 million federal grant to support cleaner buildings across the Denver metro area. This is separate from Colorado's HEAR program and provides additional rebates for energy upgrades in the region.

### Massachusetts Mass Save Program

Mass Save continues to be one of the most generous utility-backed incentive programs in the country. Combined with state HEAR rebates, Massachusetts homeowners can access $10,000+ in total incentives for heat pump installations.

### New York EmPower+ Program

NYSERDA's EmPower+ program provides free energy efficiency upgrades to income-eligible New Yorkers, including insulation, air sealing, and HVAC equipment. Combined with HEAR, qualifying households may pay nothing out of pocket.

### Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)

The federal WAP program (administered by states) provides free weatherization services to low-income households, regardless of HOMES/HEAR status. WAP covers insulation, air sealing, and sometimes HVAC equipment. Contact your state's WAP provider to check eligibility.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Which states offer the best HVAC rebates in 2026?",
    answer: "States with active HEAR programs and generous utility rebates offer the most savings. Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, Colorado, and California lead in total available incentives, with some low-income households accessing $10,000–$14,000+ in combined rebates. However, California's program for some regions is already fully reserved, so availability is as important as total amounts."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to be low-income to get HVAC rebates?",
    answer: "No. HEAR requires income below 150% of area median income, but HOMES is available to all income levels (with higher amounts for low-income households). Utility rebates typically have no income restrictions. Manufacturer promotions are available to everyone. Even higher-income homeowners can usually access $500–$3,000+ in combined savings."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get rebates for a gas furnace in 2026?",
    answer: "Utility rebates for high-efficiency gas furnaces (97%+ AFUE) are still available from many gas utilities. However, HEAR rebates focus exclusively on electrification and do not cover gas equipment. HOMES rebates could include a gas furnace as part of a whole-home retrofit if it contributes to overall energy savings, but the program generally favors electrification."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to receive a rebate?",
    answer: "HEAR point-of-sale rebates are applied at the time of purchase through a registered contractor — you pay the reduced amount upfront. Utility rebates typically take 4–8 weeks after submitting post-installation paperwork. HOMES rebates vary by state but generally take 6–12 weeks after project completion and verification."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my state hasn't launched HOMES or HEAR yet?",
    answer: "Focus on utility rebates and manufacturer promotions, which are available now. Monitor your state energy office for program launch announcements. If you can wait, delaying your HVAC purchase until your state's programs launch could save you thousands. But don't defer essential repairs — a failing system costs more in emergency service and high energy bills."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine HOMES and HEAR rebates?",
    answer: "Not on the same project. A household can participate in both programs for different projects (for example, HEAR for a heat pump installation and HOMES for insulation/air sealing), but the same improvement cannot receive both a HOMES and a HEAR rebate."
  },
  {
    question: "Do renters qualify for HVAC rebates?",
    answer: "Yes, in some cases. HEAR rebates are available to renters for eligible appliances they own. For HVAC system replacements, the property owner would typically be the applicant. Some states allow rebates to flow through landlords for rental properties occupied by income-qualified tenants."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when my state's HEAR funding runs out?",
    answer: "Once a state's federal allocation is exhausted, the program closes for new applications. There is no guaranteed additional federal funding. Some states may create supplemental programs with state funds, but this depends on each state's budget and political priorities. Early applicants have the best chance of receiving rebates."
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I find a list of approved contractors for my state's rebate program?",
    answer: "Check your state energy office website or the program administrator's website. Most states maintain a registry of approved or registered contractors who can process HEAR rebates at the point of sale. For utility rebates, your utility company may have a preferred contractor network as well."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there rebates for smart thermostats?",
    answer: "Yes. Many utility companies offer rebates of $25–$100 for ENERGY STAR certified smart thermostats. Some utilities provide free or deeply discounted thermostats directly to customers. These are separate from HOMES/HEAR and available regardless of income. Check your utility's website for current offers."
