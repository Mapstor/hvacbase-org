# Best Casement/Vertical AC Units for Sliding Windows

The best air conditioner for casement and sliding windows in 2026 is the Soleus Air Exclusive Series (8,000 BTU, CEER 11.5, 47 dB), priced at approximately $420. Casement/vertical ACs install in the narrow vertical opening of casement (crank-out) and sliding windows that can't fit standard horizontal window units.

Standard window ACs require a double-hung window with a horizontal sill. If your home has casement, sliding, awning, or other non-standard windows, this guide covers every AC option that actually works.

<TableOfContents />

## Which Windows Need a Casement/Vertical AC?

| Window Type | Why Standard ACs Don't Fit | Casement AC Works? |
|---|---|---|
| Casement (crank-out) | Window swings outward; no horizontal sill | Yes |
| Horizontal sliding | Opens side-to-side, not up-and-down | Yes |
| Awning (top-hinged) | Opens outward from top | Depends on dimensions |
| Hopper (bottom-hinged) | Opens inward from bottom | Depends on dimensions |
| Jalousie (louvered) | Overlapping glass slats | Usually no |

## How Casement ACs Install

Unlike standard horizontal window ACs, casement/vertical units install vertically with the compressor and condenser positioned at one end (either top or bottom, depending on the model).

### Installation Steps

1. **Open the casement or sliding window** fully
2. **Attach the mounting bracket** to the window frame
3. **Insert the AC unit vertically** into the bracket with the outdoor section facing outside
4. **Extend the fill panels** to seal the remaining opening
5. **Secure with screws** and seal gaps with included weatherstrip

The fill panels are typically taller and narrower than standard accordion panels, designed to fill the vertical window opening above and/or below the AC unit.

<Callout type="warning">
**Casement ACs are heavier relative to their BTU output** compared to standard window ACs because the vertical form factor concentrates weight in a narrow area. Most 8,000 BTU casement units weigh 55–70 lbs. Use the mounting bracket — don't try to balance the unit on a narrow sill.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: 1960s Ranch with Casement Windows** — The Petersons' ranch home has casement windows throughout. They installed a Soleus Air 8,000 BTU in the living room casement window (18" wide opening). The vertical installation took 45 minutes and cools their 320 sq ft room effectively.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: Condo with Horizontal Sliding Windows** — Kim's condo has sliding windows that open horizontally. She installed a Frigidaire 8,000 BTU casement AC in the left panel opening. The unit's vertical profile fits the narrow opening, and the fill panel seals the remaining space above.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: Choosing Between Casement AC and Portable** — Diego compared a Koldfront casement AC ($470) vs. a portable AC ($380) for his bedroom with awning windows. The casement AC won on efficiency (CEER 10.5 vs. 8.5), noise (50 dB vs. 53 dB), and floor space (none vs. 2.5 sq ft). The portable was only cheaper upfront.

## Casement AC vs. Portable AC vs. Through-the-Wall

| Factor | Casement/Vertical AC | Portable AC | Through-the-Wall |
|---|---|---|---|
| Price | $400–$500 | $280–$500 | $650–$1,500 |
| Efficiency (CEER) | 10.2–11.5 | 8.0–10.5 | 10.0–11.3 |
| Noise | 47–51 dB | 48–56 dB | 43–48 dB |
| Floor Space | None | 2–4 sq ft | None |
| Window Type | Casement, sliding | Any | No window needed |
| Installation | DIY (45–60 min) | DIY (10 min) | Professional |
| Structural Modification | None | None | Wall hole |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Casement ACs fit casement, sliding, and narrow windows** that can't accommodate standard horizontal units.
2. **Soleus Air leads the category** with the best CEER (11.5) and widest model selection.
3. **BTU range is limited to 8,000–12,000** — fewer options than standard window ACs.
4. **Casement ACs are more efficient and quieter than portable ACs** — choose casement over portable whenever possible.
5. **Minimum window width is typically 14.5"–16"** — measure your opening before purchasing.
6. **Installation is DIY but takes 45–60 minutes** — longer than standard window ACs due to vertical mounting.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Can I put a regular window AC in a sliding window?",
    answer: "Not directly. Standard window ACs are designed for double-hung windows that open vertically. For horizontal sliding windows, you need a casement/vertical AC or a portable AC with a sliding window adapter kit. Some people create DIY plexiglass adapter panels, but this is less secure and less well-sealed than a purpose-built casement AC."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the smallest casement window AC?",
    answer: "The Koldfront CAC8000W has the narrowest profile at 14 inches wide, fitting openings as small as 14.5 inches. Most casement ACs start at 14.5-15 inches wide. If your window opening is under 14 inches, a portable AC is your only option."
  },
  {
    question: "Are casement ACs less efficient than regular window ACs?",
    answer: "Slightly. The best casement ACs reach CEER 11.5, while the best standard window ACs reach CEER 15.5. The compact vertical form factor limits coil size and airflow, reducing efficiency. However, casement ACs are still 15-25% more efficient than portable ACs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a casement AC in a double-hung window?",
    answer: "Technically yes, but there's no reason to — standard window ACs offer more BTU options, higher efficiency, lower noise, and lower prices for double-hung windows. Use casement ACs only for windows that can't fit standard horizontal units."
  },
  {
    question: "How loud are casement window ACs?",
    answer: "Most casement ACs run 47-51 dB on low, which is louder than premium standard window ACs (38-44 dB) but quieter than portable ACs (48-56 dB). The compact form factor limits noise reduction options. For bedrooms, the Soleus Air at 47 dB is the quietest casement option."
  },
  {
    question: "Do casement ACs come with heating?",
    answer: "A few models include electric resistance heating, but options are limited compared to standard window ACs. If you need heating with a casement-compatible form factor, a portable AC with heat or a ductless mini split may offer more choices."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a casement AC cool a large room?",
    answer: "The largest casement ACs top out at 12,000 BTU, covering rooms up to 500-550 sq ft. For larger spaces, you'd need two casement units, a through-the-wall installation, or a ductless mini split. The 10,000-12,000 BTU casement models handle most typical rooms adequately."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I install a casement AC in an awning window?",
    answer: "Awning windows (hinged at top, opening outward) can sometimes accept a casement AC if the opening dimensions match. The unit mounts vertically with the outdoor section at the bottom. Fill panels seal the remaining space. Not all awning windows work — measure the clear opening when fully open and compare to the AC's minimum requirements."
