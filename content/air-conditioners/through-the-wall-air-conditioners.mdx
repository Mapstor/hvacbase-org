# Best Through-the-Wall Air Conditioners (2026)

A through-the-wall (TTW) air conditioner installs in a permanent metal sleeve cut into an exterior wall, delivering the same cooling as a window AC without occupying a window. The best TTW unit in 2026 is the Friedrich WCT12A30A (12,000 BTU, EER 11.3, 44 dB), priced at approximately $680 plus $80 for the wall sleeve.

Through-the-wall units are ideal for rooms without suitable windows, buildings where window ACs are prohibited, and permanent installations where seasonal removal isn't desired. Total installation cost typically ranges from $650–$1,500 including the unit, sleeve, and professional labor.

## How Through-the-Wall ACs Differ from Window ACs

The internal refrigeration system is identical — both use vapor-compression with an evaporator, condenser, and compressor. The key differences are mounting and airflow:

| Feature | Window AC | Through-the-Wall AC |
|---|---|---|
| Installation location | Window opening | Dedicated wall opening |
| Mounting | Sits on windowsill, sash holds in place | Slides into permanent metal sleeve |
| Rear airflow direction | Straight back (outdoor) | Straight back through wall |
| Side ventilation | Some models vent from sides | Never — sides sealed by wall sleeve |
| Seasonal removal | Easy (20 minutes) | Not typically removed |
| Interchangeability | Any brand in any window | Must match sleeve dimensions |

<Callout type="warning">
**A window AC and a through-the-wall AC are NOT interchangeable.** Window ACs vent from the sides and back; TTW units vent only from the rear because the wall sleeve blocks side airflow. Installing a window AC in a wall sleeve restricts airflow and can cause compressor overheating and failure. Always buy a unit specifically rated for through-the-wall installation.

## Wall Sleeve Specifications

The wall sleeve is a metal chassis permanently mounted in the wall opening. The AC unit slides into it like a drawer.

### Standard Sleeve Dimensions

| Sleeve Type | Width | Height | Depth Range | Fits Wall Thickness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard residential | 26"–27" | 16"–17.5" | 16"–20" | 4"–16" |
| PTAC-style (commercial) | 42" | 16" | 16"–20" | 4"–16" |
| Compact residential | 24" | 15" | 14"–18" | 4"–12" |

Most residential TTW ACs use a 26"×16.5" sleeve. Always buy the sleeve specified by the AC manufacturer to ensure proper fit, airflow, and weathersealing.

### Installation Requirements

| Requirement | Detail | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Wall opening | Rectangular hole through exterior wall, sized to sleeve | Included in labor |
| Structural assessment | Verify no load-bearing elements will be cut | $0–$200 (separate inspection) |
| Framing | Wood header and jack studs around opening | Included in labor |
| Insulation | Seal around sleeve perimeter | $10–$30 materials |
| Exterior weatherproofing | Flashing, caulk, trim | $20–$50 materials |
| Electrical | Dedicated outlet near installation | $150–$300 if not existing |
| Total professional installation | Cut, frame, sleeve, seal, electrical | $200–$600 labor |

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: Hotel Renovation** — The Bayshore Inn replaced 48 aging PTAC units with Friedrich WET12A33A through-the-wall models. Each unit slides into the existing wall sleeve, providing both cooling and heating. Room-by-room temperature control with no ductwork. Installation per room: 2 hours, $180 labor.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: Brownstone Without Window Access** — The Lees' Brooklyn brownstone had ornamental windows that couldn't accommodate a window AC. They installed a Friedrich WCT12A30A through a side wall for $1,350 total (unit + sleeve + professional installation). The unit cools their 500 sq ft living area without touching any windows.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: Condo with HOA Window Restrictions** — Maria's condo HOA bans window-mounted ACs for aesthetic reasons. She installed an LG through-the-wall unit ($720 + $90 sleeve + $400 installation = $1,210 total). The wall-mounted unit sits flush against the exterior and doesn't violate the HOA's rules. Heat pump mode provides supplemental winter heating.

## TTW vs. Window AC: Cost Comparison

| Factor | Window AC | Through-the-Wall AC |
|---|---|---|
| Unit cost (12K BTU) | $400–$520 | $580–$780 |
| Sleeve/mounting | $0 (uses window) | $70–$100 |
| Installation labor | $0 (DIY) | $200–$600 |
| Total upfront | $400–$520 | $850–$1,480 |
| Efficiency (12K BTU) | CEER 11.5–15.15 | EER 10.0–11.3 |
| Annual electricity | $64–$84 | $86–$97 |
| Seasonal removal | Required in cold climates | Not needed |

Through-the-wall units cost 2–3x more upfront and are slightly less efficient than the best window ACs. Their value proposition is: permanent installation, no window blockage, and suitability for rooms without compatible windows.

## Key Takeaways

1. **TTW units are functionally identical to window ACs** but mount in a wall sleeve instead of a window.
2. **Friedrich dominates the TTW market** with the widest selection and best build quality.
3. **Never install a window AC in a wall sleeve** — side airflow blockage causes overheating and compressor failure.
4. **Total installation costs $650–$1,500** (unit + sleeve + labor). Budget $200–$600 for professional wall cutting and framing.
5. **TTW units with heat** (Friedrich WET, LG HNR, Frigidaire FHTE) provide year-round climate control in a single unit.
6. **Best for: rooms without windows, HOA-restricted buildings, permanent installations, and hotel/commercial use.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Can I install a regular window AC in a wall?",
    answer: "No. Window ACs vent from the sides and back, while wall sleeves seal the sides completely. A window AC in a wall sleeve will overheat because the condenser can't get adequate airflow. Always use a unit specifically designed for through-the-wall installation."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does through-the-wall AC installation cost?",
    answer: "Total installed cost ranges from $650-$1,500: unit ($480-$780), wall sleeve ($70-$100), and professional installation ($200-$600). Installation cost varies by wall material — wood frame is cheapest, brick and masonry cost more due to specialized cutting tools required."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for through-the-wall AC?",
    answer: "Many municipalities require a permit for cutting into an exterior wall, typically $50-$200. Check with your local building department. In some areas, the permit requirement only applies to load-bearing walls. Your contractor should handle the permit process."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I replace a TTW unit without a contractor?",
    answer: "If the wall sleeve is already installed, replacing the unit is a simple slide-out/slide-in process that takes 15-30 minutes with no tools. This is a major advantage of the TTW design — future replacements are as easy as changing a light bulb."
  },
  {
    question: "Are through-the-wall ACs louder than window ACs?",
    answer: "Generally similar or slightly quieter. The sealed wall sleeve provides better noise isolation than a window sash and accordion panels. The best TTW units reach 43-44 dB, comparable to premium window ACs. The wall mass itself adds sound dampening."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I install a TTW AC in a rented apartment?",
    answer: "Only with explicit written landlord approval, which is unlikely because it requires cutting a permanent hole in the wall. Most landlords won't authorize this modification. If the building already has wall sleeves (common in hotels and some older apartments), replacing the unit within an existing sleeve is typically allowed."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do through-the-wall ACs last?",
    answer: "TTW units typically last 10-15 years — slightly longer than window ACs (8-12 years) because they're not subjected to seasonal installation/removal stress. Friedrich commercial-grade units can last 15+ years with regular maintenance."
  },
  {
    question: "What wall thickness can a TTW sleeve accommodate?",
    answer: "Standard TTW sleeves adjust to fit wall thicknesses from 4 inches to 16 inches, covering everything from single-stud interior walls to thick masonry exterior walls. Check the sleeve's depth range specification before purchasing."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a mini split better than a through-the-wall AC?",
    answer: "Mini splits are more efficient (SEER2 20-42 vs. EER 10-11.3) and much quieter (19-32 dB vs. 43-48 dB), but cost 2-3x more installed ($2,500-$4,000 vs. $850-$1,500). If budget allows and you want year-round heat pump efficiency, choose a mini split. If you want simpler, more affordable single-room cooling, a TTW unit delivers."
  },
  {
    question: "Can through-the-wall ACs provide heating?",
    answer: "Yes — many models include electric resistance heating (Friedrich WET series, LG HNR, Frigidaire FHTE). Some LG models offer heat pump heating, which is more efficient. Heating capacities typically range from 3,500-11,200 BTU, suitable for supplemental heating in mild to moderate winters."
