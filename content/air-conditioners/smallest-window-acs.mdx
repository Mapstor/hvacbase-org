# Smallest Window AC Units for Small Windows (Compact)

The smallest window air conditioner in 2026 is the Frigidaire FFRE053WAE at 16" H × 18.6" W × 15.4" D, weighing just 38 lbs and fitting window openings as narrow as 23". For truly narrow windows (under 23"), the Koldfront WAC6002WCO at 17.7" W fits openings as small as 18".

If your window is smaller than average, you need to match the AC's physical dimensions and minimum window requirements to your actual opening. This guide lists every compact window AC with exact measurements.

## Compact Window AC Dimensions Ranked by Width

| Rank | Model | BTU | Width | Height | Depth | Weight | Min Window Width |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Koldfront WAC6002WCO | 6,000 | 17.7" | 13.0" | 15.6" | 42 lbs | 18" |
| 2 | Frigidaire FFRE053WAE | 5,000 | 18.6" | 13.4" | 15.4" | 38 lbs | 19" |
| 3 | Haier QHNG06AC | 6,000 | 18.9" | 13.3" | 17.2" | 44 lbs | 19.5" |
| 4 | TCL 5W3E1-A | 5,000 | 19.0" | 13.8" | 15.0" | 40 lbs | 19.5" |
| 5 | Frigidaire FFRA051WAE | 5,000 | 19.2" | 13.0" | 15.5" | 37 lbs | 20" |
| 6 | GE AHQ05LZ | 5,000 | 19.7" | 13.5" | 17.5" | 43 lbs | 20.5" |
| 7 | Midea MAW05M1WWT | 5,000 | 19.5" | 13.6" | 16.8" | 41 lbs | 20" |

## Compact Window ACs Ranked by Height (for Short Windows)

If your sash doesn't open high enough, the unit's height is the limiting factor:

| Rank | Model | BTU | Height | Width | Min Opening Height | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Koldfront WAC6002WCO | 6,000 | 13.0" | 17.7" | 13.5" | 42 lbs |
| 2 | Frigidaire FFRA051WAE | 5,000 | 13.0" | 19.2" | 13.5" | 37 lbs |
| 3 | Haier QHNG06AC | 6,000 | 13.3" | 18.9" | 13.5" | 44 lbs |
| 4 | Frigidaire FFRE053WAE | 5,000 | 13.4" | 18.6" | 14" | 38 lbs |
| 5 | GE AHQ05LZ | 5,000 | 13.5" | 19.7" | 14" | 43 lbs |
| 6 | TCL 5W3E1-A | 5,000 | 13.8" | 19.0" | 14.5" | 40 lbs |

<Callout type="tip">
**Check both width AND height.** Your window opening must exceed the AC's physical dimensions by at least 0.5" in each direction. A unit that's 18.6" wide needs a window opening of at least 19" to allow clearance for the side panels and mounting hardware.

## How to Measure for a Compact Window AC

1. **Raise the sash fully** — remove any sash stops that limit travel
2. **Measure the clear opening width** between inside edges of the frame
3. **Measure the clear opening height** from sill top to bottom of raised sash
4. **Measure sill depth** from interior edge to where the sash closes
5. **Check that the sill is level** and can support the unit's weight

| Measurement | Where to Measure | Typical Minimum |
|---|---|---|
| Width | Between inside frame edges | 18"–23" |
| Height | Sill to bottom of raised sash | 13"–14" |
| Sill depth | Interior edge to sash closure | 3.5"–4" |

## Compact ACs: Performance Tradeoffs

Smaller physical size means smaller coils, smaller fans, and less airflow, which affects performance:

| Tradeoff | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Lower BTU range | Max 6,000–8,000 BTU | Size correctly for your room |
| Slightly lower efficiency | CEER typically 10.5–12.5 | Accept or buy inverter model |
| Higher noise per BTU | Smaller fans spin faster | Choose the quietest option |
| Less dehumidification | Smaller evaporator coil | Adequate for small rooms |

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: Narrow Brownstone Windows** — The Wongs' 1890s brownstone has 20" wide windows. The Koldfront WAC6002WCO (17.7" wide) fits with room for side panels. It cools their 150 sq ft bedroom adequately at 6,000 BTU.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: Short Window Opening** — Miguel's apartment sash only opens 13.5 inches. The Frigidaire FFRA051WAE (13.0" tall) fits with just enough clearance. At 5,000 BTU, it handles his 130 sq ft room.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: Older Home, Unusual Window Dimensions** — The Johnsons have 1940s windows measuring 19" wide × 14" tall. The Haier QHNG06AC (18.9" × 13.3") fits perfectly with proper side panel extension.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The smallest window ACs are 17.7"–19" wide** and fit openings from 18"–20".
2. **Minimum height is 13.0"** — any window that opens at least 13.5" can fit the shortest compact models.
3. **All compact ACs are 5,000–6,000 BTU**, covering rooms up to 200–250 sq ft.
4. **Weight ranges from 37–44 lbs** — easy solo installation for any compact model.
5. **Measure both width and height** — either dimension can be the limiting factor.
6. **If your window is under 18" wide**, a casement/vertical AC or portable AC is needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What is the narrowest window AC available?",
    answer: "The Koldfront WAC6002WCO at 17.7 inches wide is the narrowest standard window AC. It fits openings as small as 18 inches. For openings under 18 inches, you need a casement/vertical AC (fits 14.5 inches+) or a portable AC."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a compact window AC above 6,000 BTU?",
    answer: "Compact dimensions and high BTU don't go together well. Larger coils needed for 8,000+ BTU require more physical space. The smallest 8,000 BTU units are about 21-22 inches wide and 14-15 inches tall — within normal window AC dimensions. True compact models (under 20 inches wide) max out at 6,000 BTU."
  },
  {
    question: "Do compact window ACs work as well as full-size units?",
    answer: "At equivalent BTU ratings, yes — a 5,000 BTU compact unit provides the same cooling as a 5,000 BTU full-size unit. The compact models may be slightly noisier (smaller fans spin faster) and slightly less efficient (smaller coils), but the cooling output per BTU is identical."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my window is too small for any AC?",
    answer: "If your window opening is under 18 inches wide or under 13 inches tall, no standard window AC will fit. Your options are: casement/vertical ACs (for openings 14.5+ inches wide), portable ACs (needs only 4-6 inches of opening for the exhaust adapter), or through-the-wall units (bypass the window entirely)."
  },
  {
    question: "Are compact window ACs lighter?",
    answer: "Yes. Compact 5,000-6,000 BTU units weigh 37-44 lbs — significantly lighter than standard 8,000-12,000 BTU units at 55-75 lbs. Every compact model on this list is manageable for solo installation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a compact AC cool a 200 sq ft room?",
    answer: "A 6,000 BTU compact AC covers up to 250 sq ft under standard conditions. A 5,000 BTU compact AC covers up to 150-200 sq ft. For a 200 sq ft room, choose a 6,000 BTU model if sun exposure is moderate or heavy."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the sill depth important for compact ACs?",
    answer: "Yes. Compact ACs still extend 15-17 inches deep. The sill depth only needs to be 3.5-4 inches to support the indoor portion, but the outdoor portion hangs past the sill. Ensure no exterior obstructions (awnings, shutters, shrubs) interfere with the protruding section."
  },
  {
    question: "Do compact ACs come with smart features?",
    answer: "Most compact/budget ACs don't include Wi-Fi or smart home integration. The Haier QHNG06AC is an exception with basic smart control. If smart features matter, you may need to size up to an 8,000 BTU unit from LG or Midea, which are slightly larger but include comprehensive Wi-Fi control."
