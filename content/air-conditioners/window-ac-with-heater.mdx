# Best Window AC Units with Heat (2-in-1 Combos)

The best window AC with heat in 2026 is the Friedrich CCW10B10A Chill Premier (10,000 BTU cooling / 10,000 BTU heating, CEER 12.0, ~$520). Window AC heater combos provide both cooling and supplemental heating in a single unit, eliminating the need for a separate space heater during shoulder seasons and mild winters.

Most window AC heaters use electric resistance heating (100% efficient). A few models offer heat pump operation (200–300% efficient) which costs significantly less to run. Here's everything you need to know about picking the right combo unit.

<TableOfContents />

## Two Types of Window AC Heating

### Electric Resistance (Most Common)

Electric resistance converts electricity directly to heat at exactly 100% efficiency (1 kWh = 3,412 BTU). It works at any outdoor temperature but costs 2–3x more to operate than heat pump heating.

### Heat Pump (Reverse Cycle)

Heat pump mode reverses the refrigeration cycle to pull heat from outdoor air into your room. At 47°F outdoor, efficiency is 200–300% (2–3 kWh of heat per 1 kWh of electricity). Efficiency drops as outdoor temperature decreases, and most window AC heat pumps stop working effectively below 40°F.

| Heating Type | How It Works | Efficiency | Effective Range | Operating Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Electric Resistance | Electricity → direct heat | 100% (COP 1.0) | Any temperature | High ($0.05/kWh heat) |
| Heat Pump | Extracts outdoor heat | 200–300% (COP 2.0–3.0) | Above 40°F outdoor | Low ($0.02–$0.03/kWh heat) |

## Top Window ACs with Heat Ranked

| Rank | Model | Cool BTU | Heat BTU | CEER | Heat Type | Noise | Price |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Friedrich CCW10B10A | 10,000 | 10,000 | 12.0 | Resistance | 46 dB | $520 |
| 2 | Friedrich CCW08B10A | 8,000 | 3,500 | 12.0 | Resistance | 45 dB | $480 |
| 3 | LG LW1221HRSM | 12,000 | 11,200 | 10.5 | Heat Pump | 48 dB | $580 |
| 4 | Frigidaire FHWH082WA1 | 8,000 | 3,500 | 11.5 | Resistance | 48 dB | $380 |
| 5 | Frigidaire FHWH112WA1 | 11,000 | 10,600 | 10.2 | Heat Pump | 49 dB | $520 |
| 6 | Keystone KSTAW10AHP | 10,000 | 8,000 | 10.0 | Heat Pump | 51 dB | $450 |
| 7 | GE AHE08DX | 8,000 | 3,800 | 10.8 | Resistance | 49 dB | $350 |

## Heating Cost Comparison

Monthly heating costs for a 300 sq ft room in a 40°F winter (8 hours/day):

| Unit Type | Monthly Heating Cost | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|
| Window AC heat pump | $35–$50 | COP 2.0–3.0 |
| Window AC resistive heat | $75–$110 | COP 1.0 |
| Portable space heater | $75–$110 | COP 1.0 |
| Mini split heat pump | $20–$35 | COP 3.0–5.0 |
| Gas furnace (forced air) | $30–$55 | 80–96% AFUE |

<Callout type="info">
**Electric resistance heating in a window AC is identical in cost to a standalone space heater.** Both convert electricity to heat at 100% efficiency. The only convenience advantage is having one unit that handles both seasons. If you need serious winter heating, a mini split heat pump (COP 3.0–5.0) or central heating is far more cost-effective.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: Mild Winter, Shoulder Season Heating** — Andrea uses a Friedrich CCW10B10A in her Austin, TX apartment. Winter lows rarely drop below 35°F, so the electric resistance heat provides comfortable supplemental warmth from November through February. Her winter heating cost: about $45/month, replacing a $30 portable heater + $150 window AC (net savings: one less appliance to store).

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: Heat Pump for Fall/Spring** — Ryan in Nashville chose the LG LW1221HRSM heat pump model. In temperatures above 45°F (October, November, March, April), the heat pump mode heats his 450 sq ft living room for about $35/month — roughly half what electric resistance would cost. Below 40°F (December-February), he switches to his central gas furnace.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: Year-Round Single Room** — Janet's converted garage workshop in Raleigh has no central HVAC. She installed a Frigidaire FHWH112WA1 heat pump window AC. It cools in summer and heats in fall/spring. For the coldest winter weeks, she supplements with a small ceramic heater. Total annual HVAC cost: ~$300 for a 250 sq ft space.

## When a Window AC with Heat Makes Sense

| Situation | Good Choice? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Mild winters (above 40°F) | Yes | Heat pump models are efficient |
| Shoulder seasons only | Yes | Supplemental heat for fall/spring |
| Primary winter heat (cold climate) | No | Electric resistance is expensive |
| Single room with no HVAC | Yes | All-in-one convenience |
| Replacing space heater + window AC | Maybe | Saves space, similar cost |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Friedrich Chill Premier leads the combo category** with the best build quality and solid efficiency.
2. **Heat pump models (LG, Frigidaire, Keystone) cost half as much to heat** compared to electric resistance — but only work above ~40°F outdoor.
3. **Electric resistance heating is NOT a primary heating solution** for cold climates — it's equally expensive to a space heater.
4. **Combo units add $50–$150 to the price** over cooling-only models. Worth it if you genuinely use both functions.
5. **Best for: mild climates, shoulder seasons, single rooms without central HVAC, and eliminating the need for a separate space heater.**
6. **If serious heating is your priority**, a mini split heat pump ($1,500–$3,500) is far more efficient and works in much colder temperatures.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to heat with a window AC?",
    answer: "Electric resistance heating costs $75-$110/month for a 300 sq ft room (8 hrs/day, 40°F outdoor, $0.168/kWh). Heat pump models cost $35-$50/month under the same conditions. These are supplemental heating costs — not replacements for primary heating in cold climates."
  },
  {
    question: "Do window AC heaters work in freezing temperatures?",
    answer: "Electric resistance models work at any temperature. Heat pump models lose efficiency below 40°F and most stop producing meaningful heat below 25-30°F. For temperatures regularly below freezing, electric resistance is the only window AC heating option, but it's expensive to run as primary heat."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a window AC with heat better than a separate space heater?",
    answer: "Convenience-wise, yes — one unit handles both seasons. Cost-wise, electric resistance window AC heat is identical to a space heater (both 100% efficient). Heat pump window AC models are cheaper to run than any space heater. The main advantage is eliminating a separate appliance."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the heating while the window is open to cold outside?",
    answer: "You should seal the window AC just as well for heating as for cooling. Cold air infiltration through gaps around the unit makes the heater work harder and costs more. The same foam tape and weatherstrip used for summer sealing should remain in place for winter heating."
  },
  {
    question: "Do combo units cool as well as cooling-only models?",
    answer: "At the same BTU rating, yes. Adding a heating element or reversing valve doesn't affect cooling performance. However, combo units tend to have lower CEER ratings than the best cooling-only inverter models because the added components take space from the cooling system."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the most efficient window AC heater?",
    answer: "The LG LW1221HRSM heat pump model is the most efficient at heating, with a COP of approximately 2.5-3.0 at 47°F. It produces 2.5-3 times more heat per watt than electric resistance models. However, it only works effectively above 40°F outdoor temperature."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I leave the window AC heater in the window all winter?",
    answer: "If you use the heating function, yes — leave it installed and well-sealed. If you don't use the heating, remove it for winter to eliminate the thermal bridge and save 5-10% on heating costs. An uncovered window AC in winter acts as a cold-air leak even when turned off."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a window AC heat an entire apartment?",
    answer: "No. A window AC heater (3,500-11,200 BTU heat output) handles one room of 200-500 sq ft. It cannot heat an entire apartment through doorways and hallways. Each room needing heat requires its own unit, or you need central heating or a multi-zone mini split system."
