# Minimum SEER Rating by State in 2026 (SEER2 Requirements Map)

**Every state in the U.S. has a federally mandated minimum SEER2 rating for new air conditioner and heat pump installations, determined by which of the DOE's three climate regions it falls in.** Northern states require a minimum of 13.4 SEER2 for split-system ACs, while Southern and Southwestern states require 14.3 SEER2. Installing a unit below your state's minimum is illegal and can result in fines, void warranties, and disqualify you from rebates.

Find your state below to see the exact minimum SEER2 and HSPF2 requirements for 2026.

### Southwest Region States

These states also require **14.3 SEER2** for split ACs and **15.2 SEER2 / 7.5 HSPF2** for split heat pumps:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["State", "Abbr", "Split AC Min", "Split HP Min SEER2", "Split HP Min HSPF2"]}

    ["New Mexico", "NM", "14.3 SEER2", "15.2", "7.5"],
  ]}
/>

## Old SEER Equivalents for Context

If you're comparing these minimums to older equipment rated in SEER:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["New SEER2 Minimum", "Approximate Old SEER Equivalent", "Applies To"]}
  rows={[
    ["13.4 SEER2", "~14 SEER", "North region split ACs"],
    ["14.3 SEER2", "~15 SEER", "South/SW split ACs, North split HPs"],
    ["15.2 SEER2", "~16 SEER", "South/SW split heat pumps"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="important">
**All regions saw effective increases in minimum efficiency.** Even though 13.4 SEER2 looks close to the old 13 SEER minimum, it actually represents roughly 14 SEER in old terms. The DOE raised the real-world bar while switching to the new metric.
</Callout>

## Special Cases and Exceptions

### State-Level Requirements Above Federal

Some states enforce efficiency requirements above the federal minimum. California has historically been the most aggressive, with its Title 24 building code sometimes requiring higher standards. Check with your state energy office and local building department for any additional requirements beyond federal minimums.

### Packaged vs Split Systems

Packaged systems (where the compressor and air handler are in a single outdoor unit) have different minimums than split systems. Packaged ACs have a uniform 13.4 SEER2 minimum regardless of region. This lower minimum reflects the different engineering constraints of packaged systems.

### Small-Duct High-Velocity Systems

Small-duct high-velocity (SDHV) systems, such as Unico and SpacePak, have separate (lower) efficiency minimums because their unique design creates inherently higher static pressure. Check AHRI for specific SDHV minimum requirements.

## Consequences of Installing Below-Minimum Equipment

Installing a system that doesn't meet your region's minimum SEER2 requirement can result in several problems:

Building inspectors may fail the installation, requiring expensive replacement or retrofit. Manufacturer warranties may be voided if the unit is installed in violation of federal standards. You'll be ineligible for utility rebates, federal tax credits, and many state incentives. Your HVAC contractor may face fines and licensing issues. In some jurisdictions, the homeowner may also be liable.

<Callout type="warning">
**Verify before you buy.** Some online retailers sell equipment without verifying regional compliance. If you purchase a 13.4 SEER2 unit online and live in Florida (which requires 14.3 SEER2), no reputable contractor will install it. Always confirm your region's requirement first.
</Callout>

## How This Affects Replacement Decisions

If your current system is 10-15 years old, any replacement in 2026 will be significantly more efficient than what you have, regardless of which region you're in:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Your Current System", "Minimum Replacement SEER2 (North)", "Efficiency Improvement"]}
  rows={[
    ["10 SEER (pre-2006)", "13.4 SEER2 (~14 SEER)", "34-40% more efficient"],
    ["13 SEER (2006-2014)", "13.4 SEER2 (~14 SEER)", "7-8% more efficient"],
    ["14 SEER (2015-2022)", "13.4 SEER2 (~14 SEER)", "Similar or slightly better"],
  ]}
/>

Even replacing a code-minimum 13 SEER unit from 2008 with today's code-minimum 13.4 SEER2 delivers a small efficiency improvement plus the benefits of newer technology, better refrigerant, and fresh equipment with a full warranty.

## Key Takeaways

- **Three DOE regions** determine your minimum SEER2: North (13.4), South (14.3), and Southwest (14.3) for split-system ACs
- **Heat pumps have higher minimums:** 14.3 SEER2 (North) and 15.2 SEER2 (South/Southwest)
- **All regions require 7.5 HSPF2** minimum for split-system heat pumps
- **These minimums represent a real increase** over pre-2023 levels when adjusted for the tougher SEER2 testing
- **Some states have additional requirements** above federal minimums (check your state energy office)
- **Packaged systems have a uniform 13.4 SEER2** minimum nationwide
- **Installing below-minimum equipment is illegal** and disqualifies you from warranties, rebates, and tax credits
- **Any replacement of a 10-15 year old system** will provide significant efficiency improvements

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What is the minimum SEER2 rating required in my state?",
    answer: "It depends on your DOE climate region. Northern states require 13.4 SEER2 for split ACs. Southern states (AL, AR, DE, FL, GA, HI, KY, LA, MD, MS, NC, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA, DC) and Southwestern states (AZ, CA, NV, NM) require 14.3 SEER2. Check the tables above for your specific state."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I install an AC below the SEER2 minimum?",
    answer: "Installing below-minimum equipment violates federal energy conservation standards. Building inspectors may reject the installation, manufacturer warranties may be voided, and you'll be ineligible for utility rebates and tax credits. Your contractor may face fines and licensing consequences."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to replace my existing AC if it's below the current minimum?",
    answer: "No. Federal minimums apply only to new installations. Your existing equipment can continue operating regardless of its SEER rating. However, when you eventually replace it, the new system must meet current minimums for your region."
  },
  {
    question: "Are minimum SEER2 requirements going to increase again?",
    answer: "The DOE periodically reviews and updates energy conservation standards. The current SEER2 minimums took effect January 1, 2023. Future increases are possible but would go through a rulemaking process with public comment periods. For gas furnaces, a new 90% AFUE minimum in northern states is already finalized for 2029."
  },
  {
    question: "Does my state have requirements above the federal minimum?",
    answer: "Most states follow only the federal minimum, but some states (particularly California, with its Title 24 building code) may have additional requirements. Check with your state energy office or local building department. Some local jurisdictions within states may also have additional codes."
  },
  {
    question: "What minimum applies if I live near a regional border?",
    answer: "The minimum is determined by the state where the equipment is installed, regardless of proximity to a regional boundary. For example, Virginia (South region, 14.3 SEER2 minimum) borders West Virginia (North region, 13.4 SEER2 minimum). Your state determines the requirement."
