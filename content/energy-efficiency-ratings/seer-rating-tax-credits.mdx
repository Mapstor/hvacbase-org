# SEER Rating Requirements for Federal Tax Credits (2026)

**To claim the federal 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit in 2026, a central air conditioner must meet ENERGY STAR Most Efficient criteria — currently 17.5 SEER2 or higher for split systems.** Heat pumps qualifying as "high-efficiency" can earn a larger credit of up to $2,000 and must meet both SEER2 and HSPF2 thresholds. The credit covers 30% of the equipment and installation cost, with annual limits of $600 for ACs and gas furnaces, or $2,000 for heat pumps.

This is the most generous HVAC tax credit available to homeowners, and it resets every tax year through 2032. Here's exactly what efficiency ratings you need, how much you'll save, and how to claim the credit.

<TableOfContents />

## 2026 Tax Credit Overview: Section 25C

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 extended and expanded the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (Section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code) through December 31, 2032. Key features:

The credit is **30% of qualified costs** (equipment + installation labor). There's an **annual aggregate limit of $3,200** across all qualifying improvements, with sub-limits by category. The credit is **non-refundable**, meaning it reduces your tax liability but won't generate a refund beyond what you owe. The credit resets every year, so you can claim it multiple years in a row for different improvements.

<Callout type="important">
**This is a tax credit, not a deduction.** A $600 credit reduces your tax bill by $600 directly — dollar for dollar. A $600 deduction would only save you $600 × your marginal tax rate (e.g., $132 at 22%). Credits are far more valuable.
</Callout>

## Exact SEER2 and Efficiency Requirements

### Central Air Conditioners — Up to $600

/>

<Callout type="tip">
**Heat pumps offer the biggest tax advantage.** The $2,000 heat pump credit is separate from and in addition to the $600 limit for ACs and furnaces. If you install a qualifying heat pump, you get up to $2,000, and you can still claim up to $600 for a furnace in the same year if both are installed (e.g., a dual-fuel system). The total annual cap across all 25C credits is $3,200.
</Callout>

## Annual Credit Limits Breakdown

The $3,200 annual aggregate breaks down into two sub-categories:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Sub-Category", "Annual Limit", "Qualifying Items"]}
  rows={[
    ["Heat Pumps, Heat Pump Water Heaters, Biomass Stoves", "$2,000", "Air-source heat pumps, geothermal heat pumps, heat pump water heaters"],
    ["All Other Qualified Improvements", "$1,200", "Central AC ($600 cap), furnaces ($600 cap), insulation, windows ($600 cap), doors ($500 cap), energy audits ($150 cap), electrical panel upgrades ($600 cap)"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Maximizing your 2026 credits**

You install a qualifying heat pump ($12,000) and replace old windows ($8,000) in 2026:
- Heat pump credit: 30% × $12,000 = $3,600, capped at **$2,000**
- Window credit: 30% × $8,000 = $2,400, capped at **$600**
- **Total 2026 credit: $2,600**

In 2026, you replace your furnace ($6,000) and add insulation ($3,000):
- Furnace credit: 30% × $6,000 = $1,800, capped at **$600**
- Insulation credit: 30% × $3,000 = **$900** (no sub-limit beyond the $1,200 aggregate)
- **Total 2026 credit: $1,200** (hits the $1,200 "other improvements" sub-cap since no heat pump was installed that year)
</Callout>

## Which AC and Heat Pump Models Qualify?

Rather than guessing, use the ENERGY STAR product finder to confirm a specific model meets the criteria. Here's a general guide by brand:

### Central ACs Meeting 17.5+ SEER2

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Brand", "Qualifying Model Lines", "SEER2 Range", "Est. Installed Cost"]}
  rows={[
    ["Carrier", "Infinity 24 (24VNA4), Infinity 19VS", "19–24 SEER2", "$7,000–$12,000"],
    ["Trane", "XV20i, XR17", "17–22 SEER2", "$6,500–$11,000"],
    ["Lennox", "XC21, XC25", "19–26 SEER2", "$7,000–$13,000"],

    ["American Standard", "AccuComfort Platinum 20", "18–22 SEER2", "$6,500–$11,000"],
  ]}
/>

### Heat Pumps Meeting 16+ SEER2 / 9.0+ HSPF2

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Brand", "Qualifying Model Lines", "SEER2", "HSPF2", "Est. Installed Cost"]}
  rows={[
    ["Carrier", "Infinity 24 HP (25VNA4)", "22–24", "10–11", "$8,000–$14,000"],

## How to Claim the 25C Tax Credit

Follow these steps to claim your credit when filing taxes:

**Step 1: Confirm eligibility before purchasing.** Verify the specific model number qualifies using the ENERGY STAR product finder or the AHRI certification directory. Get the manufacturer's certification statement — you'll need this for your tax records.

**Step 2: Keep all documentation.** Save the purchase receipt, installation invoice (showing labor costs separately), manufacturer certification statement, and the model/serial number plate photo. You don't file these documents with your return, but you must keep them in case of an audit.

**Step 3: Complete IRS Form 5695.** Use Part II of Form 5695 (Residential Energy Credits) to calculate your credit. Enter the total qualified costs (equipment + labor) and calculate 30% of that amount, subject to the applicable cap.

**Step 4: Transfer to Form 1040.** The credit from Form 5695 flows to Schedule 3 (Additional Credits and Payments) of your Form 1040.

<Callout type="warning">
**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Claiming the credit for a rental property (only applies to your primary residence)
- Exceeding the annual cap and carrying excess to future years (the 25C credit does not carry forward)
- Forgetting to include labor costs (they count toward the 30% calculation)
- Installing equipment that meets ENERGY STAR but not ENERGY STAR Most Efficient criteria (the thresholds differ)
</Callout>

## State and Utility Rebates: Stacking Savings

The federal tax credit can be combined with state incentives and utility rebates, which vary widely:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Incentive Type", "Typical Amount", "Where to Find"]}
  rows={[
    ["Federal 25C Tax Credit", "$600 AC / $2,000 HP", "IRS Form 5695"],
    ["State Tax Credits", "$0–$1,500", "dsireusa.org"],
    ["Utility Rebates", "$200–$2,000", "Your utility company website"],
    ["IRA 25D (Geothermal)", "30% uncapped", "IRS Form 5695 Part I"],
    ["High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebates (HEEHRA)", "Up to $8,000 for HP", "State energy office"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**The HEEHRA program (part of the IRA) offers point-of-sale rebates for heat pumps — up to $8,000 for qualifying households.** Eligibility is income-based (under 150% of area median income). These rebates are being rolled out state by state through 2026 and beyond. Check your state energy office for availability. These rebates can be combined with the 25C tax credit for significant total savings.
</Callout>

## Special Case: Geothermal Heat Pumps (Section 25D)

Geothermal (ground-source) heat pumps qualify for the even more generous Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit: **30% of total system cost with no dollar cap.** For a typical $20,000–$30,000 geothermal installation, that's a $6,000–$9,000 credit.

Unlike 25C, the 25D credit is available through 2032 at 30%, stepping down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. It also carries forward if you don't have enough tax liability to use it in one year.

## Tax Credit vs Long-Term Savings: Total Value

To understand the full financial impact, let's look at a complete scenario:

<Callout type="example">
**Scenario: Replacing a 12 SEER AC with an 18 SEER2 heat pump in Charlotte, NC**

- Old system: 12 SEER AC + 80% AFUE gas furnace, $1,800/year combined energy costs
- New system: 18 SEER2 / 10 HSPF2 heat pump, estimated $1,100/year energy costs
- Installation cost: $10,000
- Federal tax credit: $2,000 (heat pump qualifies for $2,000 cap)
- Duke Energy rebate: $500
- Net cost after incentives: $7,500
- Annual savings: $700
- Simple payback: 10.7 years
- 15-year net savings: $3,000+ (after accounting for upfront cost minus incentives)

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What SEER rating do I need for the federal tax credit?",
    answer: "For central air conditioners, you need a split system rated at 17.5 SEER2 or higher (and 12.0 EER2 or higher) to qualify for the 25C tax credit. For heat pumps, the threshold is lower: 16.0 SEER2 with 9.0 HSPF2. The AC credit is capped at $600, while the heat pump credit goes up to $2,000."
  },
  {
    question: "How much is the 2026 HVAC tax credit?",
    answer: "The 2026 federal HVAC tax credit (Section 25C) covers 30% of qualified costs. Central air conditioners are capped at $600 per year. Heat pumps are capped at $2,000 per year. Gas furnaces are capped at $600 per year. The total annual limit across all energy-efficient home improvements is $3,200."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim the tax credit for a heat pump AND a furnace in the same year?",
    answer: "Yes. The $2,000 heat pump credit is in a separate sub-category from the $600 furnace credit. If you install a dual-fuel system (heat pump + gas furnace backup) and both meet their respective efficiency thresholds, you can claim up to $2,600 in the same tax year."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the tax credit cover installation labor?",
    answer: "Yes. The 25C credit applies to the total cost of equipment plus installation labor. This is a significant benefit — installation typically costs 40–60% of the total project price. Make sure your contractor itemizes equipment and labor on the invoice."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the 25C credit refundable?",
    answer: "No, the 25C credit is non-refundable. It can reduce your federal tax liability to zero but won't generate a refund. If your tax liability is less than the credit amount, the unused portion is lost — it does not carry forward to future years. Plan installations in years when you have sufficient tax liability."
  },
  {
    question: "Does this credit apply to rental properties?",
    answer: "No. The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit applies only to your principal residence (primary home). Rental properties, second homes, and vacation homes do not qualify. The home must be located in the United States."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to submit any forms to the manufacturer?",
    answer: "No, but you need to obtain and keep the manufacturer's certification statement confirming the product meets the required efficiency criteria. Most manufacturers post these on their websites. Keep this document with your tax records — you don't file it with your return, but you'll need it if audited."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine the federal tax credit with state rebates?",
    answer: "Yes. Federal tax credits can be combined with state tax credits, utility rebates, and IRA-funded rebate programs (like HEEHRA). However, if a state rebate reduces your out-of-pocket cost, the 30% federal credit is calculated on the cost after subtracting the rebate. Consult a tax professional for specifics."
