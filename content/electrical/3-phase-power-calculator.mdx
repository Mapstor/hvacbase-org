# 3-Phase Power Calculator: kW to Amps, Amps to kW

**For 3-phase power at 480V with power factor 0.85: 10 kW = 14.2 amps, and 50 amps = 35.3 kW.** The formulas differ from single-phase because 3-phase power uses three conductors carrying current 120° out of phase with each other, resulting in the √3 (1.732) factor that appears in all 3-phase calculations.

Use the calculator below for instant conversions, then review the formulas and reference tables for common 3-phase HVAC and commercial equipment.

## 3-Phase Power Formulas

### kW to Amps (3-Phase)

**Amps = (kW × 1,000) ÷ (Volts × √3 × Power Factor)**

For 480V at PF 0.85:
**Amps = kW × 1,000 ÷ (480 × 1.732 × 0.85) = kW × 1.415**

### Amps to kW (3-Phase)

**kW = (Amps × Volts × √3 × Power Factor) ÷ 1,000**

For 480V at PF 0.85:
**kW = Amps × 480 × 1.732 × 0.85 ÷ 1,000 = Amps × 0.707**

### kVA to Amps (3-Phase)

**Amps = (kVA × 1,000) ÷ (Volts × √3)**

For 480V:
**Amps = kVA × 1,000 ÷ (480 × 1.732) = kVA × 1.203**

### Amps to kVA (3-Phase)

**kVA = (Amps × Volts × √3) ÷ 1,000**

For 480V:
**kVA = Amps × 480 × 1.732 ÷ 1,000 = Amps × 0.831**

<Callout type="important">
**Power Factor (PF) is crucial for kW calculations.** kVA is "apparent power" (volts × amps). kW is "real power" (what actually does work). The relationship: kW = kVA × PF. Motors typically have PF of 0.80–0.90. Resistive loads (heaters) have PF of 1.0. Always check equipment nameplates for actual PF.

## Understanding 3-Phase Power

### What Is 3-Phase Power?

3-phase power uses three conductors, each carrying alternating current that peaks at different times (120° apart). This provides:

1. **More efficient power delivery:** ~1.73× the power of single-phase with only 1.5× the conductors
2. **Smoother motor operation:** Constant power delivery (no pulsing like single-phase)
3. **Smaller equipment:** Motors, generators, and transformers are physically smaller for the same power rating

### 3-Phase vs. Single-Phase Comparison

| Property | Single-Phase | 3-Phase |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Conductors | 2 (hot + neutral) or 2 hots | 3 hots (+ neutral for 4-wire) |
| Power formula | V × I × PF | V × I × √3 × PF |
| 10kW at 240V | 41.7A (PF 1.0) | 24.1A (PF 1.0) |
| Motor smoothness | Pulsating torque | Constant torque |
| Residential use | Standard | Rare (large homes) |
| Commercial use | Small loads | Standard |
| Wire sizing (10kW) | Larger | Smaller |

### Common 3-Phase Voltages

| Voltage | Configuration | Common Use |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| 208V | 3-phase wye | Small commercial HVAC, motors |
| 240V | 3-phase delta | Motor loads, welders |
| 380V | 3-phase wye (European) | International equipment |
| 480V | 3-phase wye | Large commercial/industrial HVAC |
| 600V | 3-phase wye (Canada) | Industrial in Canada |

<Callout type="info">
**208V 3-phase is NOT the same as 240V single-phase.** In a 208V 3-phase wye system, 208V is the line-to-line voltage (120V line-to-neutral × √3 = 208V). Equipment rated for 240V single-phase may not work correctly on 208V 3-phase — the voltage is 13% lower, which affects motor performance and heater output.

<Callout type="warning">
**Motor circuits have special sizing rules.** NEC Article 430 requires conductors sized at 125% of motor full-load current, and overcurrent protection sized up to 250% for standard motors (to handle starting current). Always reference NEC Tables 430.248–430.250 for motor FLA values rather than nameplate data.
</Callout>

## Power Factor Correction

### Why Power Factor Matters

Low power factor means:
- Higher current for the same real power
- Larger wire sizes needed
- Utility penalties (commercial accounts)
- Reduced transformer capacity

| Load Type | Typical Power Factor |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Incandescent lighting | 1.00 |
| Resistive heating | 1.00 |
| LED lighting (good ballast) | 0.90–0.98 |
| Fluorescent lighting | 0.85–0.95 |
| AC motors (full load) | 0.85–0.90 |
| AC motors (partial load) | 0.50–0.80 |
| VFD-driven motors | 0.95–0.99 |
| Welders | 0.50–0.70 |

### Calculating Capacitor kVAR for Correction

**kVAR needed = kW × (tan(cos⁻¹(PF₁)) - tan(cos⁻¹(PF₂)))**

To correct 100 kW load from PF 0.75 to PF 0.95:
- tan(cos⁻¹(0.75)) = 0.882
- tan(cos⁻¹(0.95)) = 0.329
- kVAR = 100 × (0.882 - 0.329) = **55.3 kVAR**

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Sizing Wire for 3-Phase RTU

**Scenario:** 20-ton rooftop unit, 480V 3-phase. Nameplate: 30 kW, PF 0.85.

**Calculation:**
- Amps = 30,000 ÷ (480 × 1.732 × 0.85) = 42.5A
- 125% for continuous load = 53.1A
- Wire: 6 AWG copper (65A ampacity)
- Breaker: Per NEC 440, up to 175% of 42.5A = 74.4A → 70A or 80A

### Example 2: Converting HP to kW

**Scenario:** 25 HP motor, 480V, 3-phase. What's the power draw?

**From NEC Table 430.250:** 25 HP at 460V = 34A FLA

**Power calculation:**
- kVA = 34 × 480 × 1.732 ÷ 1000 = 28.3 kVA
- Assuming PF 0.87: kW = 28.3 × 0.87 = 24.6 kW

**Verification:** 25 HP × 0.746 kW/HP = 18.65 kW mechanical output. At ~75% motor efficiency: 18.65 ÷ 0.75 = 24.9 kW input. ✓

### Example 3: Panel Load Calculation

**Scenario:** New commercial HVAC installation with:
- (2) 10-ton AC units at 14 kW each
- (1) 30 kW electric heater
- (4) 2 HP exhaust fans at 2.5 kW each

**Total load:**
- AC units: 2 × 14 = 28 kW
- Heater: 30 kW
- Fans: 4 × 2.5 = 10 kW
- **Total: 68 kW**

**Current at 480V, PF 0.85:**
- Amps = 68,000 ÷ (480 × 1.732 × 0.85) = 96.3A
- With demand factors, likely ~80A effective

**Service:** 200A, 3-phase, 480V service with room for growth

### Example 4: Comparing 208V vs. 480V Wiring Cost

**Scenario:** 50 kW load requires wiring. Compare 208V and 480V options.

| Voltage | Amps (PF 0.85) | Wire Size | Approx. Cost (100 ft, 3 conductors) |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 208V | 163A | 2/0 AWG | $800–$1,200 |
| 480V | 70.9A | 4 AWG | $200–$350 |

**Savings at 480V:** ~$500–$850 in wire costs alone, plus smaller conduit, easier installation.

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **3-phase formula: Amps = kW × 1000 ÷ (V × √3 × PF)** — the √3 factor (1.732) is essential
- **Power factor matters:** PF 0.85 is typical for motors; PF 1.0 for resistive heating
- **480V uses ~2.3× less current than 208V** for the same power — smaller wire, lower cost
- **Motor FLA from NEC tables, not nameplates** — use Tables 430.248–430.250
- **kVA ≠ kW** — kW = kVA × Power Factor (real power vs. apparent power)
- **Motor circuits:** Wire at 125% of FLA, breakers up to 175–250% of FLA
- **Always verify voltage configuration:** 208V 3-phase ≠ 240V single-phase

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How do I convert kW to amps in 3-phase?",
    answer: "Use the formula: Amps = (kW × 1000) ÷ (Volts × 1.732 × Power Factor). For example, 20 kW at 480V with PF 0.85: Amps = 20,000 ÷ (480 × 1.732 × 0.85) = 28.3 amps. The 1.732 (√3) factor accounts for the 3-phase power relationship."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between kW and kVA?",
    answer: "kW is real power (what actually does useful work). kVA is apparent power (volts × amps without considering power factor). The relationship: kW = kVA × Power Factor. For a motor with PF 0.85, a 100 kVA load consumes only 85 kW of real power — the rest is reactive power that oscillates between source and load."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I calculate amps for a 3-phase motor?",
    answer: "Use NEC Table 430.250 for motor full-load amps (FLA) rather than calculating from HP. For example, a 25 HP motor at 460V is 34A per the NEC table. To calculate: Amps ≈ (HP × 746) ÷ (V × 1.732 × Efficiency × PF), but tables are more accurate because they account for typical motor characteristics."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is 3-phase more efficient than single-phase?",
    answer: "3-phase delivers approximately 1.73× more power than single-phase with only 1.5× the conductors. It also provides constant power (no pulsating like single-phase), which means smoother motor operation and smaller motors/generators for the same output. This reduces wire costs, motor sizes, and energy losses."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the √3 (1.732) factor in 3-phase calculations?",
    answer: "The √3 factor accounts for the phase relationship in 3-phase systems. The three phases are 120° apart, and when you calculate the combined power or current relationship, the geometry results in √3 multiplying the single-phase equivalent. This is a fundamental property of 3-phase systems."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I size wire for a 3-phase motor?",
    answer: "Per NEC Article 430, motor branch circuit conductors must be sized at 125% of the motor's full-load current (FLA). Look up FLA in NEC Tables 430.248–430.250, multiply by 1.25, and select wire from NEC Table 310.16. For example, a 10 HP motor at 460V has 14A FLA; 14 × 1.25 = 17.5A → 14 AWG minimum (20A ampacity)."
  },
  {
    question: "What power factor should I use for calculations?",
    answer: "Use 0.85 as a default for motor loads if actual PF is unknown. Resistive loads (heaters) have PF = 1.0. VFD-driven motors have PF 0.95–0.99. Motors at partial load have lower PF (0.50–0.80). For accurate calculations, check the equipment nameplate or spec sheet for actual power factor."
  },
  {
    question: "Is 208V 3-phase the same as 240V?",
    answer: "No. 208V 3-phase comes from a wye transformer (120V line-to-neutral × √3 = 208V line-to-line). It's 13% lower than 240V, which can affect equipment performance. Motors rated for 240V may run slightly slower and cooler on 208V. Heaters produce only 75% of rated output (power ∝ V²). Always verify equipment is rated for your actual voltage."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I calculate 3-phase power consumption?",
    answer: "Real power: kW = (V × I × √3 × PF) ÷ 1000. Apparent power: kVA = (V × I × √3) ÷ 1000. For energy consumption: kWh = kW × hours of operation. Example: A 20 kW load running 8 hours consumes 160 kWh. At $0.10/kWh, that's $16/day."
  },
  {
    question: "What size breaker for a 3-phase motor?",
    answer: "NEC Article 430 allows motor branch circuit breakers up to 250% of FLA for standard motors (to handle starting current). Example: 10 HP motor at 460V = 14A FLA. Maximum breaker = 14 × 2.5 = 35A. Standard sizes are 30A or 40A. Use the next standard size up if the calculated value falls between sizes."
