# Power Consumption Calculator: Estimate Your Electric Bill

**The average U.S. household uses 10,500 kWh per year — about 886 kWh per month — costing $147/month at the national average rate of $0.166/kWh (EIA, 2026).** Your actual bill depends on which appliances you run, how long they operate, and your local electricity rate, which ranges from $0.10/kWh in Louisiana to $0.45/kWh in Hawaii.

Use the calculator below to estimate energy costs for any appliance or your whole home. Then reference our comprehensive wattage tables to find exactly how much power each device draws.

<TableOfContents />

## How to Calculate Power Consumption

The formula is straightforward. Every appliance has a wattage rating, and you're billed by the kilowatt-hour (kWh).

**Basic formula:**

**Monthly Cost = (Watts × Hours per Day × 30) ÷ 1,000 × Rate per kWh**

Breaking it down:
1. **Watts** = power the appliance draws (check the nameplate or our tables below)
2. **Hours per day** = how long it actually runs, not how long it's plugged in
3. **÷ 1,000** = converts watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh)
4. **× Rate** = your electricity rate in $/kWh (check your utility bill)

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Central AC running cost**
A 3-ton central AC draws about 3,500 watts. In summer, it might run 8 hours per day.
- Monthly: (3,500 × 8 × 30) ÷ 1,000 = 840 kWh
- At $0.166/kWh: 840 × $0.166 = **$139.44/month**
- Annual (5 months of heavy use): $139.44 × 5 = **$697.20/year**

## How to Read Your Electric Bill

Your electricity bill contains several charges that affect total cost beyond the simple $/kWh rate.

| Bill Component | What It Is | Typical Amount |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Energy charge | Cost per kWh consumed | $0.08–$0.45/kWh |
| Delivery charge | Cost to transmit power to your home | $0.02–$0.08/kWh |
| Demand charge (if applicable) | Charge based on peak usage | $5–$15/kW of peak demand |
| Customer charge | Fixed monthly fee | $5–$20/month |
| Fuel adjustment | Pass-through of fuel cost changes | Variable, ±$0.01–$0.03/kWh |
| Taxes and fees | Local, state, federal | 5–15% of total |

**Your "all-in" rate** includes all of these components. When you see the state averages above, those represent the total billed amount divided by total kWh — the effective rate you actually pay.

### Understanding Tiered Rates

Many utilities use tiered pricing where your rate increases as you use more power.

| Tier | Usage Range | Example Rate |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Tier 1 (baseline) | 0–500 kWh | $0.12/kWh |
| Tier 2 | 501–1,000 kWh | $0.18/kWh |
| Tier 3 | 1,001–1,500 kWh | $0.26/kWh |
| Tier 4 | 1,500+ kWh | $0.36/kWh |

With tiered rates, your marginal cost (the cost of each additional kWh) is much higher than your average cost. Running a 5,000W electric furnace for 8 hours adds 40 kWh per day — at Tier 4 rates, that's $14.40/day vs. $4.80/day at Tier 1.

## What Uses the Most Electricity in Your Home?

Based on EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey data, here's the average U.S. home electricity breakdown.

| End Use | % of Total | Annual kWh | Monthly Cost ($0.166/kWh) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Space cooling (AC) | 16.3% | 1,712 | $23.68/month avg |
| Space heating (electric) | 14.8% | 1,554 | $21.50/month avg |
| Water heating (electric) | 13.8% | 1,449 | $20.04/month avg |
| Lighting | 9.6% | 1,008 | $13.94/month avg |
| Refrigeration | 6.8% | 714 | $9.87/month avg |
| TV and entertainment | 5.4% | 567 | $7.84/month avg |
| Laundry (washer + dryer) | 5.1% | 536 | $7.41/month avg |
| Cooking | 3.2% | 336 | $4.65/month avg |
| Computers and electronics | 3.0% | 315 | $4.36/month avg |
| Other (misc.) | 22.0% | 2,310 | $31.95/month avg |

<Callout type="important">
**The Big Three — HVAC, water heating, and lighting — account for roughly 55% of your electric bill.** This is where efficiency upgrades have the most impact. Upgrading from a 10 SEER AC to a 20 SEER2 heat pump can cut your cooling bill in half. Switching from a standard electric water heater to a heat pump model saves 60–70%. Replacing all incandescent bulbs with LEDs saves 75–80%.

## Real-World Cost Examples

### Example 1: Summer Cooling Cost in Phoenix, AZ

**Setup:** 2,400 sq ft home, 5-ton AC (6,000W), Arizona electricity at $0.139/kWh. AC runs an estimated 14 hours/day in July.

- Daily: 6,000W × 14 hrs ÷ 1,000 = 84 kWh × $0.139 = $11.68/day
- Monthly (July): $11.68 × 31 = **$362.08** just for cooling
- Summer season (May–Sept, 5 months): ~$1,450

**Savings with 20 SEER2 upgrade:** A 20 SEER2 unit uses roughly 40% less energy than a 14 SEER unit. Monthly cooling drops to ~$217, saving $145/month or $725/season.

### Example 2: Electric vs. Gas Water Heater Annual Cost

**Setup:** Family of 4, 50-gallon water heater, moderate usage (64 gallons/day).

| Fuel Type | Annual Energy | Unit Cost | Annual Cost |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Electric tank (4,500W, 0.95 EF) | 4,773 kWh | $0.166/kWh | $792 |
| Gas tank (40,000 BTU, 0.60 EF) | 258 therms | $1.20/therm | $310 |
| Electric heat pump (COP 3.5) | 1,364 kWh | $0.166/kWh | $226 |
| Tankless gas (0.95 EF) | 163 therms | $1.20/therm | $196 |
| Tankless electric (0.99 EF) | 4,585 kWh | $0.166/kWh | $761 |

The heat pump water heater is the most cost-effective electric option, rivaling gas on operating costs while eliminating gas infrastructure requirements.

### Example 3: Whole-Home Electrification Cost Impact

**Setup:** 2,000 sq ft home converting from gas heating/cooking to all-electric. Current electric usage: 700 kWh/month. Rate: $0.166/kWh.

| New Electric Load | Added Monthly kWh | Added Monthly Cost |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Heat pump (replacing gas furnace) | 500–900 kWh (winter) | $83–$149 |
| Heat pump water heater (replacing gas tank) | 120–180 kWh | $20–$30 |
| Induction cooktop (replacing gas range) | 30–60 kWh | $5–$10 |
| EV charger (replacing gas car) | 300–600 kWh | $50–$100 |
| Total added | 950–1,740 kWh | $158–$289 |

**New monthly electric bill:** $116 (base) + $158–$289 = $274–$405. However, you eliminate $120–$200/month in gas bills plus $100–$200/month in gasoline costs. Net savings for most households: $50–$150/month.

### Example 4: Phantom Load / Standby Power Audit

**Setup:** Typical home with 30+ devices drawing standby power 24/7.

| Device Category | Standby Watts | Count | Total Watts | Annual kWh | Annual Cost |
|----------------|--------------|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Smart TV | 2–5W | 3 | 6–15W | 53–131 | $8.80–$21.75 |
| Cable/streaming box | 15–25W | 2 | 30–50W | 263–438 | $43.66–$72.71 |
| Gaming console | 2–15W | 1 | 2–15W | 18–131 | $2.99–$21.75 |
| Computer (sleep) | 3–10W | 2 | 6–20W | 53–175 | $8.80–$29.05 |
| Microwave (clock) | 3–5W | 1 | 3–5W | 26–44 | $4.32–$7.30 |
| Coffee maker (clock) | 1–3W | 1 | 1–3W | 9–26 | $1.49–$4.32 |
| Phone/tablet chargers | 0.5–2W | 5 | 2.5–10W | 22–88 | $3.65–$14.61 |
| Smart speakers | 2–4W | 3 | 6–12W | 53–105 | $8.80–$17.43 |
| WiFi router/modem | 8–15W | 2 | 16–30W | 140–263 | $23.24–$43.66 |
| **Total standby** | — | — | **73–160W** | **637–1,401** | **$105.74–$232.57** |

That's $100–$230/year in standby power alone — equivalent to leaving a light on 24/7. Smart power strips that cut standby power can save 5–10% of your total electric bill.

## Understanding Power Units

| Unit | Definition | Relationship | Example |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Watt (W) | Rate of energy use at one instant | Base unit | A 60W light bulb draws 60 watts |
| Kilowatt (kW) | 1,000 watts | 1 kW = 1,000 W | A 3-ton AC draws about 3.5 kW |
| Kilowatt-hour (kWh) | 1 kW used for 1 hour | What you're billed for | Running 3.5 kW for 8 hours = 28 kWh |
| Megawatt-hour (MWh) | 1,000 kWh | Utility-scale | Average home uses ~10.5 MWh/year |
| Amp (A) | Rate of current flow | W = V × A | 15A at 120V = 1,800W |
| Volt (V) | Electrical pressure | W = V × A | Standard outlet = 120V |
| BTU | Thermal energy unit | 1 kWh = 3,412 BTU | 12,000 BTU = 1 ton of cooling |

**Quick conversions you'll use constantly:**
- Watts to amps (120V): Amps = Watts ÷ 120
- Watts to amps (240V): Amps = Watts ÷ 240
- kWh to cost: kWh × your rate = cost
- BTU to watts: BTU ÷ 3.412 = watts
- Tons of cooling to watts: Tons × 3,517 = watts (at 12 EER)

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How many kWh does the average home use per month?",
    answer: "The average U.S. home uses approximately 886 kWh per month (10,632 kWh per year) according to the EIA. This varies significantly by region: Louisiana homes average 1,140 kWh/month due to heavy AC use, while Hawaii homes average only 515 kWh/month due to mild climate and high electricity prices that encourage conservation."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run an air conditioner per month?",
    answer: "A central air conditioner costs $70–$300 per month depending on size, efficiency, climate, and electricity rate. A 3-ton unit drawing 3,500W and running 8 hours daily costs about $139/month at the national average rate. In hot climates like Arizona where AC runs 14+ hours daily, monthly cooling costs can exceed $350."
  },
  {
    question: "What uses the most electricity in a house?",
    answer: "HVAC (heating and cooling) is typically the largest electricity consumer at about 31% of total usage. Water heating is second at approximately 14%, followed by lighting at 10%. Together, these three categories account for over half of the average electric bill."
  },
  {
    question: "How much electricity does a space heater use?",
    answer: "A standard 1,500W space heater running 8 hours per day uses 360 kWh per month, costing about $60/month at the national average rate. Running one 24/7 would cost $179/month. Space heaters are efficient for heating a single room but far more expensive than central heating for an entire home."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I calculate my electricity cost?",
    answer: "Multiply the appliance's wattage by hours of daily use, multiply by 30 for monthly, divide by 1,000 to convert to kWh, then multiply by your electricity rate. Formula: (Watts × Hours/Day × 30) ÷ 1,000 × Rate. Your rate is on your electric bill, typically between $0.10 and $0.30 per kWh."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to charge an electric car at home?",
    answer: "Charging an EV at home costs roughly $30–$90 per month for average driving (1,000 miles/month). At the national average rate of $0.166/kWh, a Tesla Model 3 costs about $41.50/month to charge (250 kWh). Off-peak charging at $0.08/kWh drops this to $20/month. Either way, it's 2–3× cheaper than gasoline."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it cheaper to run a window AC or central AC?",
    answer: "A window AC is cheaper if you're cooling one or two rooms. A 10,000 BTU window unit costs $27–$55/month vs. $105–$175/month for a 3-ton central system. However, running 3+ window units to cool an entire home costs more than central AC due to lower efficiency. Central AC is more efficient per BTU of cooling when conditioning the whole house."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does standby power cost per year?",
    answer: "Standby (phantom) power from always-on devices costs the average U.S. home $100–$230 per year. The biggest culprits are cable boxes, gaming consoles in rest mode, and older smart TVs. Using smart power strips that cut standby power to entertainment centers and home offices can save $50–$150 annually."
  },
  {
    question: "How much electricity does a heat pump water heater use?",
    answer: "A heat pump water heater uses 120–180 kWh per month for a family of 4, costing $20–$30/month at average rates. This is 60–70% less than a standard electric tank water heater (405–675 kWh/month, $67–$112/month). The heat pump model extracts heat from surrounding air, using electricity only to run the compressor — not to directly heat water."
  },
  {
    question: "Do solar panels eliminate my electric bill?",
    answer: "Solar panels can significantly reduce or even eliminate your electric bill, but results depend on system size, sun exposure, and net metering policies. A typical 8kW residential system generates 900–1,200 kWh/month in sunny areas — enough to offset the average home's usage. With net metering, excess daytime production offsets nighttime usage. However, many utilities now charge minimum connection fees of $10–$30/month regardless of usage."
