# Electrical Panel Upgrade Cost: 100 to 200 Amp (2026 Pricing)

**Upgrading from a 100-amp to 200-amp electrical panel costs $1,500–$4,000 for the panel replacement alone, or $3,000–$6,000 when utility-side work (meter socket, weatherhead, service drop) is required.** The total cost depends on whether your existing service entrance wiring is adequate, whether the utility needs to upgrade the service drop, and local labor rates.

This is one of the most common electrical upgrades in 2026, driven by heat pumps, EV chargers, and home electrification. Here's exactly what to expect for costs, timelines, and what's involved.

<TableOfContents />

## Panel Upgrade Cost Summary (2026)

| Upgrade Type | Cost Range | Includes |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Panel swap only (wiring adequate) | $1,500–$2,500 | New 200A panel, breakers, labor |
| Panel + meter socket | $2,000–$3,500 | Above + new meter base |
| Full service upgrade | $3,000–$6,000 | Panel + meter + weatherhead + utility coordination |
| Full upgrade + service drop | $4,000–$8,000 | Above + utility re-run (overhead or underground) |
| Smart panel (Span, Lumin) | $5,000–$8,000 | 200A smart panel with load management |

<Callout type="important">
**"Panel upgrade" can mean different things.** A simple panel swap (replacing the 100A panel box with a 200A panel) costs $1,500–$2,500 if your service entrance wiring is already 200A-capable. A full service upgrade including utility-side work costs $3,000–$6,000+. Get quotes for both scenarios if you're uncertain about your current wiring.

## Types of Panel Upgrades

### Type 1: Panel Swap Only ($1,500–$2,500)

**When it applies:** Your service entrance wiring (from meter to panel) is already rated for 200A — typically 2/0 copper or 4/0 aluminum. This is common in homes built after 1990 that simply have a 100A panel installed on 200A-capable wiring.

**What's done:**
- Remove old 100A panel
- Install new 200A panel (same location)
- Transfer existing circuits
- Add new 200A main breaker
- Verify grounding system

**Timeline:** 4–8 hours, single day.

### Type 2: Panel + Meter Socket ($2,000–$3,500)

**When it applies:** The meter socket (outside the house) is only rated for 100A and must be replaced along with the panel. The service entrance cable from utility to meter may be adequate, but the meter base isn't.

**What's done:**
- Everything in Type 1
- Replace meter socket (meter base)
- Coordinate with utility for meter pull/reinstall
- Possible weatherhead/mast upgrade

**Timeline:** 1–2 days, including utility coordination.

### Type 3: Full Service Upgrade ($3,000–$6,000)

**When it applies:** The entire service entrance — from the utility connection down to the panel — needs upgrading. Common in homes built before 1980 with original electrical.

**What's done:**
- New 200A panel
- New 200A meter socket
- New service entrance cable (2/0 copper or 4/0 aluminum)
- New weatherhead and mast
- New grounding electrode system
- Permit and inspections
- Utility coordination

**Timeline:** 1–3 days, depending on utility scheduling.

### Type 4: Full Upgrade + Service Drop ($4,000–$8,000)

**When it applies:** The utility's service drop (the wires from the pole or transformer to your house) is inadequate for 200A. This is common in rural areas or older neighborhoods with undersized utility infrastructure.

**What's done:**
- Everything in Type 3
- Utility replaces service drop (overhead) or lateral (underground)
- May require utility engineering review
- May require trenching for underground service

**Timeline:** 1–4 weeks, heavily dependent on utility scheduling.

### Type 5: Smart Panel Upgrade ($5,000–$8,000)

**When it applies:** Homeowner wants load management capabilities to maximize a 200A panel's effective capacity — common when adding EV chargers, heat pumps, and other heavy loads.

**What's done:**
- Everything in Type 1, 2, or 3 as needed
- Install Span, Lumin, or similar smart panel
- Configure load management priorities
- Set up app control and monitoring

**Timeline:** 1–2 days for panel, plus configuration.

<Callout type="tip">
**Smart panels can avoid a 320A upgrade.** If your calculated load exceeds 200A but you don't want to pay $8,000–$15,000 for 320A service, a smart panel can dynamically manage loads. For example, it can reduce EV charging when the AC is running, preventing the main breaker from tripping while keeping everything functional.
</Callout>

## When You Need a Panel Upgrade

### Clear Signs You Need More Capacity

| Sign | What It Means |
|------|--------------|
| Main breaker trips regularly | Total load exceeds panel capacity |
| Breakers trip when starting AC | Inrush current plus existing load exceeds capacity |
| Lights dim when appliances start | Voltage drop from overloaded service |
| Panel is warm to the touch | Connections overloaded — fire hazard |
| Fuse panel (not breakers) | Outdated technology, should upgrade |
| Adding EV charger (40A+) | New load may exceed capacity |
| Adding heat pump | Heat pump + strip heat may exceed capacity |
| Converting from gas to electric | Electrification dramatically increases load |

### Load Calculation: Do You Actually Need 200A?

Before assuming you need an upgrade, have an electrician perform an NEC Article 220 load calculation.

| Home Profile | Typical Calculated Load | Panel Needed |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Gas heat, gas water, no EV | 60–90A | 100A often sufficient |
| Gas heat, electric water, no EV | 70–100A | 100A may work |
| Heat pump, electric water, no EV | 90–130A | 200A recommended |
| Electric furnace, electric water | 120–170A | 200A required |
| Heat pump + EV charger (48A) | 130–170A | 200A (tight) |
| All-electric + EV + heat pump | 150–200A | 200A (load management advised) |
| All-electric + 2 EVs + hot tub | 200–280A | 320A or smart panel |

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Should you upgrade for an EV charger?**

**Current setup:** 100A panel, gas furnace, gas water heater, 3-ton AC. Calculated load: ~75A.

**Adding:** 48A EV charger (60A breaker, continuous load).

**New calculated load:** ~135A peak (but EV typically charges overnight when AC isn't running).

**Options:**
1. Upgrade to 200A panel: $1,500–$4,000
2. Install 200A smart panel: $5,000–$8,000 (manages loads automatically)
3. Install smaller EV charger (32A/40A breaker): $0 panel cost

Many EV owners in 100A homes use a 32A charger instead of upgrading. It adds 25 miles of range per hour — enough for most daily driving.
</Callout>

## What's Involved: Step-by-Step Process

### Week 1: Assessment and Permits

1. **Electrician site visit** ($0–$100) — evaluates current system, proposes scope
2. **Quote and contract** — detailed breakdown of work and costs
3. **Permit application** ($100–$300) — filed by electrician with local building department
4. **Utility notification** — if meter work required, notify utility (may need to schedule disconnect)

### Week 2–3: Installation

1. **Utility disconnects power** (if needed) — scheduled with utility, usually 24–48 hours notice
2. **Old panel removal** — existing breakers labeled and documented
3. **New panel installation** — mounted, connected to service entrance
4. **Circuit transfer** — existing circuits reconnected to new panel
5. **New circuits added** (if any) — EV charger, heat pump, etc.
6. **Grounding system verified/upgraded** — per NEC requirements
7. **Utility reconnects power** — meter reinstalled

### Week 3–4: Inspection and Finalization

1. **Rough inspection** (if walls opened) — verify wire routing
2. **Final inspection** — inspector verifies NEC compliance
3. **Utility final approval** — for new meter or service
4. **Panel labeling** — all circuits clearly identified

**Total timeline:** 1–4 weeks depending on utility coordination and permit processing.

## Cost Factors That Increase or Decrease Price

### Factors That Increase Cost

| Factor | Additional Cost | Why |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| Meter relocation | +$500–$1,500 | Moving meter requires new wiring, potentially trenching |
| Underground service | +$1,000–$3,000 | Trenching and conduit more expensive than overhead |
| Asbestos-containing panel | +$500–$2,000 | Hazmat handling and disposal |
| Federal Pacific or Zinsco panel | +$0–$500 | Extra care in removal, possible additional testing |
| Difficult access | +$200–$800 | Attic, crawlspace, or exterior work |
| Historic home requirements | +$500–$2,000 | May need to maintain appearance, use hidden conduit |
| Extensive new circuits | +$200–$500 per circuit | Adding EV, HVAC, spa circuits during upgrade |

### Factors That Decrease Cost

| Factor | Savings | Why |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Panel swap only (wiring adequate) | -$500–$2,000 | No meter or service entrance work |
| Easy access (basement, garage) | -$200–$500 | Faster installation |
| Bundling with other work | -$200–$500 | Electrician already on-site for HVAC, remodel |
| Rural area | -$500–$1,000 | Lower labor rates |
| DIY-friendly permits (homeowner pull) | -$100–$200 | Self-permit in some jurisdictions |

## Panel Upgrade for Specific Goals

### For EV Charger Installation

| Scenario | Upgrade Needed? | Best Option | Cost |
|----------|----------------|-------------|------|
| 100A panel, light loads, 32A charger | Maybe not | Keep 100A, add 40A circuit | $300–$600 |
| 100A panel, moderate loads, 48A charger | Yes | Upgrade to 200A | $1,500–$4,000 |
| 200A panel, full, 48A charger | Maybe | Add sub-panel or use smart panel | $500–$2,000 |

### For Heat Pump Installation

| Scenario | Upgrade Needed? | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| 100A + gas furnace → heat pump only | Usually not | Heat pump often uses similar amps to AC |
| 100A + heat pump with strip heat | Often yes | Strip heat adds 40–80A |
| 100A + heat pump + HPWH + induction | Almost always | Multiple new loads require 200A |

### For Full Electrification

| Conversion | Added Load | Panel Requirement |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Gas furnace → heat pump | +10–30A (outdoor unit) | 200A recommended |
| Gas water → heat pump WH | +30A (but low actual use) | 200A recommended |
| Gas water → tankless electric | +80–120A | 200A minimum, possibly 320A |
| Gas stove → induction | +40–50A | 200A recommended |
| Gas + 1 EV | +48A | 200A likely required |

<Callout type="warning">
**Avoid electric tankless water heaters if panel capacity is a concern.** A 27kW tankless requires 120A — more than half a 200A panel. A heat pump water heater uses the same 30A circuit as a standard tank but consumes only 2–3A during normal operation. For electrification on a 200A budget, heat pump water heaters are far better than tankless electric.
</Callout>

## DIY vs. Professional Installation

### Can You DIY a Panel Upgrade?

**Technically possible in some states** — many jurisdictions allow homeowners to perform electrical work on their primary residence with a permit. However, a panel upgrade involves:

- Working inside a live panel (dangerous)
- Coordinating utility disconnect/reconnect
- Meeting NEC and local code requirements
- Passing inspection

**Realistically, hire a licensed electrician.** The risks (electrocution, fire, failed inspection, insurance issues) far outweigh the $800–$1,500 labor savings. This is not comparable to wiring a new outlet — you're working with 200+ amps of potential.

### What You CAN Do to Reduce Costs

1. **Get multiple quotes** — prices vary 30–50% between electricians
2. **Schedule off-peak** — winter is slower for electricians in many regions
3. **Bundle with other work** — adding an EV circuit, HVAC circuit, or sub-panel at the same time reduces trip charges
4. **Prepare the area** — clear access to panel, move stored items
5. **Pull your own permit** (where allowed) — saves $50–$150

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to upgrade from 100 to 200 amp service?",
    answer: "A 100-to-200 amp upgrade costs $1,500–$4,000 for the panel replacement alone, or $3,000–$6,000 if the meter socket and service entrance cable also need upgrading. The total depends on whether your existing wiring is adequate and local labor rates. Get quotes for both scenarios."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for an electrical panel upgrade?",
    answer: "Yes. All jurisdictions require permits for panel upgrades because it involves changing the service entrance — a major electrical modification. The electrician typically pulls the permit, and inspections are required before the utility will reconnect power. Permit costs range from $100–$300."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a panel upgrade take?",
    answer: "The actual installation takes 4–12 hours (1 day). However, the total process — permits, utility coordination, scheduling — typically takes 1–4 weeks. Utility scheduling for meter disconnect/reconnect is often the bottleneck, especially in busy periods."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade my panel myself?",
    answer: "Some states allow homeowners to do their own electrical work with a permit, but a panel upgrade is extremely dangerous and complex. You're working with 200+ amps, coordinating utility disconnects, and meeting strict code requirements. The $800–$1,500 labor savings isn't worth the risks. Hire a licensed electrician."
  },
  {
    question: "Will upgrading to 200 amps lower my electric bill?",
    answer: "No. Panel amperage determines capacity — how much you CAN draw — not how much you DO draw. Your electric bill is based on kilowatt-hours consumed. The upgrade itself doesn't save energy. However, it enables you to add efficient equipment (heat pumps, EVs) that may lower overall energy costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need 200 amps for an EV charger?",
    answer: "Not necessarily. A 32A EV charger (adding ~25 miles of range per hour) can often fit on a 100A panel if your other loads are moderate. A 48A charger (40+ miles per hour) typically requires 200A service. Have an electrician perform a load calculation before deciding."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a panel upgrade and a service upgrade?",
    answer: "A panel upgrade replaces just the breaker panel box. A service upgrade includes the panel plus meter socket, service entrance cable, weatherhead, and potentially the utility's service drop. Panel-only upgrades cost $1,500–$2,500; full service upgrades cost $3,000–$6,000+."
  },
  {
    question: "Is 200 amp service enough for an all-electric home?",
    answer: "Usually yes, with proper planning. A home with a heat pump, heat pump water heater, induction stove, and 48A EV charger fits on 200A service. The key is avoiding electric tankless water heaters (80–120A alone). If you need more capacity, smart panels can manage 200A to handle higher theoretical loads."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my panel needs upgrading?",
    answer: "Signs include: main breaker tripping frequently, lights dimming when appliances start, panel warm to the touch, fuse panel (no breakers), or wanting to add major loads (EV, heat pump). An electrician can perform a load calculation to determine if your current service is adequate."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a smart electrical panel?",
    answer: "Smart panels (Span, Lumin) replace standard breaker panels and add load monitoring, remote control, and automatic load management. They can prioritize circuits — for example, reducing EV charging when the AC runs — effectively increasing a 200A panel's practical capacity. They cost $5,000–$8,000 installed."
