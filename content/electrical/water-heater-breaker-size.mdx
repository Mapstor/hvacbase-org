# What Size Breaker for Water Heater? (10–100 Gallon Chart)

**The vast majority of residential electric water heaters — from 30 to 80+ gallons — require a 30-amp double-pole breaker.** This is because most standard tank water heaters use either a 4,500W or 5,500W heating element, which draws 18.75–22.9 amps at 240V. With the continuous-load safety factor, a 30A breaker is the correct size.

The tank capacity (gallons) doesn't directly determine breaker size — the heating element wattage does. A compact 30-gallon and a large 80-gallon tank often use identical 4,500W elements, requiring the same 30A breaker.

## Water Heater Breaker Size Chart (By Wattage)

| Element Wattage | Amps at 240V | Continuous Load (×1.25) | Required Breaker | Wire Gauge |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------|------------|
| 1,500W | 6.25A | 7.8A | 15A DP | 14 AWG |
| 2,000W | 8.3A | 10.4A | 15A DP | 14 AWG |
| 2,500W | 10.4A | 13.0A | 15A DP | 14 AWG |
| 3,000W | 12.5A | 15.6A | 20A DP | 12 AWG |
| 3,500W | 14.6A | 18.2A | 20A DP | 12 AWG |
| 4,000W | 16.7A | 20.8A | 25A or 30A DP | 10 AWG |
| 4,500W | 18.75A | 23.4A | 30A DP | 10 AWG |
| 5,000W | 20.8A | 26.0A | 30A DP | 10 AWG |
| 5,500W | 22.9A | 28.6A | 30A DP | 10 AWG |
| 6,000W | 25.0A | 31.3A | 40A DP | 8 AWG |

<Callout type="important">
**DP = Double-Pole.** All electric water heaters operate on 240V, which requires a double-pole breaker connected to both bus bars in your electrical panel. A single-pole breaker only provides 120V and won't work. Double-pole breakers occupy two adjacent slots in your panel.

## Water Heater Breaker Size Chart (By Tank Size)

Tank size correlates loosely with element size, but the nameplate wattage is what matters. Here are typical configurations:

| Tank Size (Gallons) | Common Element(s) | Amps | Breaker | Wire | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------|------|---------|------|-------|
| 6–20 (point-of-use) | 1,500–2,500W | 6.25–10.4A | 15–20A DP | 14–12 AWG | Under-sink units |
| 20–30 (compact) | 3,000–4,000W | 12.5–16.7A | 20–25A DP | 12–10 AWG | Apartments, small homes |
| 30–40 (standard) | 4,500W | 18.75A | 30A DP | 10 AWG | Most common residential |
| 40–50 (standard) | 4,500W | 18.75A | 30A DP | 10 AWG | Most common residential |
| 50–65 (large) | 4,500–5,500W | 18.75–22.9A | 30A DP | 10 AWG | Larger families |
| 65–80 (extra-large) | 5,500W | 22.9A | 30A DP | 10 AWG | Large families, high demand |
| 80–120 (commercial) | 5,500–6,000W | 22.9–25A | 30–40A DP | 10–8 AWG | Commercial applications |

### Why Most Tanks Use 4,500W Elements

Manufacturers standardize on 4,500W because:

1. **It fits standard wiring:** 4,500W ÷ 240V = 18.75A, which stays comfortably under a 30A breaker
2. **It provides adequate recovery:** A 4,500W element heats about 21 gallons per hour — enough for typical household use
3. **It's energy-efficient enough:** Larger elements draw more power without proportionally faster recovery

Larger tanks (65–80 gallons) sometimes use 5,500W elements for faster recovery, but they still fit on a 30A circuit because 22.9A × 1.25 = 28.6A, which rounds up to 30A.

## How to Calculate Breaker Size

### Step 1: Find the Element Wattage

Check your water heater's data plate (usually on the side of the tank near the access panel). Look for:
- **Wattage (W):** The total power draw (e.g., 4500W)
- **Voltage (V):** Should be 240V or 208/240V
- **Amps (A):** May be listed directly

If only watts and volts are listed: **Amps = Watts ÷ Volts**

### Step 2: Apply the Continuous Load Factor

Water heaters are considered continuous loads because they can run for 3+ hours during heavy hot water use. NEC 422.13 requires:

**Required Breaker Ampacity = Actual Amps × 1.25**

This 125% factor provides a safety margin for sustained operation.

### Step 3: Select the Breaker

Choose the next standard breaker size equal to or greater than the calculated ampacity.

**Standard residential double-pole breaker sizes:** 15A, 20A, 25A, 30A, 35A, 40A, 45A, 50A, 60A

<Callout type="example">
**Example calculation — 4,500W water heater:**
1. Amps = 4,500W ÷ 240V = 18.75A
2. Continuous load = 18.75A × 1.25 = 23.44A
3. Next standard breaker = 25A or 30A
4. Industry standard = **30A double-pole**

Most electricians use 30A rather than 25A because 25A breakers are less common and 30A provides additional margin for voltage fluctuations.

## Tankless Water Heater Breaker Requirements

Tankless electric water heaters are completely different from tank units. They require significantly more power and multiple circuits.

| Tankless kW Rating | Total Amps | Number of Breakers | Breaker Size (each) | Total Panel Amps |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------------| -----------------|
| 8 kW | 33A | 1 | 40A DP | 40A |
| 11 kW | 46A | 1 | 60A DP | 60A |
| 13 kW | 54A | 2 | 30A DP | 60A |
| 18 kW | 75A | 2 | 40A DP | 80A |
| 24 kW | 100A | 2 | 50A DP | 100A |
| 27 kW | 113A | 3 | 40A DP | 120A |
| 29 kW | 121A | 3 | 50A DP | 150A |
| 36 kW | 150A | 4 | 40A DP | 160A |

<Callout type="warning">
**Tankless electric water heaters can overwhelm residential panels.** A 27 kW unit requires 120A of breaker capacity — 60% of a 200A panel. Before installing a tankless electric unit, have an electrician verify your panel can handle the additional load. In many cases, a [panel upgrade](/electrical-panel-upgrade-cost) is required.
</Callout>

## Heat Pump Water Heater Breaker Size

Heat pump water heaters are the most efficient electric option. They use the same breaker as standard tanks but consume far less energy.

| Type | Wattage (Heat Pump Mode) | Wattage (Backup Mode) | Breaker | Wire |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------|------|
| Hybrid (normal use) | 500–600W | N/A | 30A DP | 10 AWG |
| Hybrid (backup heating) | 4,500W | 4,500W | 30A DP | 10 AWG |
| Heat pump only | 500–600W | N/A | 30A DP | 10 AWG |

Heat pump water heaters have a backup resistance element (typically 4,500W) that activates during high-demand periods or cold ambient temperatures. The circuit is sized for this worst-case scenario, hence the 30A breaker requirement — same as a standard tank.

The energy savings come from normal operation, where the unit runs almost entirely on the heat pump (500–600W) rather than resistance heating.

## Common Breaker Sizing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using a Single-Pole Breaker

**Wrong:** Installing a 30A single-pole breaker for a 240V water heater.

**Why it fails:** Single-pole breakers supply 120V from one bus bar. Water heaters need 240V, which requires connections to both bus bars via a double-pole breaker. A single-pole breaker will either fail to power the heater at all or supply only 120V (1/4 the heating power).

**Fix:** Always use a double-pole breaker for 240V appliances.

### Mistake 2: Undersizing the Breaker

**Wrong:** Using a 20A breaker for a 4,500W water heater because "it only draws 18.75A."

**Why it's a code violation:** NEC requires continuous loads (3+ hours) to be limited to 80% of breaker capacity. A 20A breaker allows only 16A continuous — the 18.75A draw exceeds this limit. The breaker may nuisance-trip or overheat.

**Fix:** Apply the 1.25× factor. 18.75A × 1.25 = 23.4A → use a 30A breaker.

### Mistake 3: Oversizing the Breaker (More Dangerous)

**Wrong:** Using a 40A or 50A breaker on 10 AWG wire "to stop nuisance tripping."

**Why it's dangerous:** The breaker protects the wire, not the appliance. If you put a 40A breaker on 10 AWG wire (rated 30A), the wire can overheat and start a fire before the breaker trips.

**Fix:** If breaker trips repeatedly, diagnose the cause — bad element, loose connection, short circuit. Never upsize the breaker without upsizing the wire.

### Mistake 4: Not Matching Wire to Breaker

**Wrong:** Using leftover 12 AWG wire with a 30A breaker.

**Why it's a fire hazard:** 12 AWG wire is rated for only 20A per NEC 240.4(D). A 30A breaker allows 50% more current than the wire can safely carry. The wire overheats inside the wall before the breaker trips.

**Fix:** Always match wire to breaker: 30A = 10 AWG, 20A = 12 AWG, 15A = 14 AWG.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Standard 50-Gallon Tank Replacement

**Scenario:** Replacing old 50-gallon water heater. Existing circuit: 30A double-pole breaker, 10/2 NM-B wire.

**New water heater nameplate:** 4,500W, 240V

**Calculation:** 4,500 ÷ 240 = 18.75A × 1.25 = 23.4A → 30A breaker

**Verdict:** Existing 30A circuit is correct. No changes needed — just connect the new water heater.

### Example 2: Upgrading from 30-Gallon to 65-Gallon

**Scenario:** Upgrading from compact 30-gallon (3,000W) to large 65-gallon (5,500W). Existing circuit: 20A breaker, 12/2 wire.

**New calculation:** 5,500 ÷ 240 = 22.9A × 1.25 = 28.6A → 30A breaker

**Problem:** Existing 12 AWG wire can only support 20A. 30A breaker on 12 AWG = fire hazard.

**Solution:** Run new 10/2 NM-B cable and install 30A double-pole breaker. Do not reuse the existing wire.

### Example 3: Adding Tankless Under-Sink Unit

**Scenario:** Installing 4 kW point-of-use tankless under kitchen sink for instant hot water.

**Calculation:** 4,000 ÷ 240 = 16.7A × 1.25 = 20.8A → 25A or 30A breaker

**Wire:** 10 AWG minimum (30A) or 12 AWG with 20A if the unit draws under 16A (check specs)

**Panel impact:** One additional double-pole breaker, minimal compared to whole-house tankless.

### Example 4: Converting from Gas to Electric

**Scenario:** Gas water heater failed; homeowner wants to switch to electric 50-gallon tank. No existing 240V circuit to water heater location.

**Required new circuit:**
- Breaker: 30A double-pole
- Wire: 10/2 NM-B
- Run: 40 feet (basement to water heater location)
- Cost: Materials $60–$100, professional install $250–$500

**Panel check:** Verify panel has two adjacent open slots for the double-pole breaker.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "What size breaker do I need for a 50 gallon water heater?",
    answer: "Most 50-gallon water heaters require a 30-amp double-pole breaker. This is because standard 50-gallon tanks use 4,500W elements, which draw 18.75A at 240V. With the continuous load factor (×1.25), the minimum required breaker is approximately 24A, so a 30A breaker is used."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a 20-amp breaker for a water heater?",
    answer: "Only for small water heaters under 3,500W. A 20A breaker allows only 16A continuous load (80% of 20A). Standard 4,500W water heaters draw 18.75A, which exceeds this limit. Using a 20A breaker for a 4,500W heater violates code and can cause nuisance tripping or overheating."
  },
  {
    question: "What size breaker for a 40 gallon water heater?",
    answer: "A 40-gallon water heater typically uses a 4,500W element and requires a 30-amp double-pole breaker with 10 AWG wire. The calculation: 4,500W ÷ 240V = 18.75A × 1.25 = 23.4A, which rounds up to a 30A breaker."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my water heater keep tripping the breaker?",
    answer: "Common causes include: (1) a bad heating element with a short to ground, (2) loose wire connections causing arcing, (3) a failing thermostat, (4) water intrusion into the electrical compartment, or (5) an undersized breaker for the element wattage. Have an electrician diagnose the issue — do not simply upsize the breaker."
  },
  {
    question: "What size breaker for a tankless water heater?",
    answer: "Tankless electric water heaters require multiple large breakers — typically 2–4 double-pole breakers rated 40A–50A each, depending on the kW rating. An 18 kW unit needs two 40A breakers; a 27 kW unit needs three 40A breakers. The total panel load can reach 80–160A, often requiring a panel upgrade."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I run a water heater on a 15-amp circuit?",
    answer: "Only for very small point-of-use units under 2,500W (about 10A at 240V). Standard residential water heaters draw 18–23A and require a 30A circuit. Using a 15A breaker for a standard water heater will cause immediate and repeated tripping."
  },
  {
    question: "Do water heaters need a dedicated circuit?",
    answer: "Yes. Electric water heaters must be on a dedicated circuit — no other appliances or outlets can share the circuit. This is required by NEC and ensures the full breaker capacity is available for the water heater's continuous load."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a single-pole and double-pole breaker?",
    answer: "A single-pole breaker connects to one bus bar and supplies 120V. A double-pole breaker connects to both bus bars simultaneously and supplies 240V. Electric water heaters require 240V, so they must use a double-pole breaker — single-pole won't work."
  },
  {
    question: "How many watts can a 30-amp 240V circuit handle?",
    answer: "A 30A/240V circuit can theoretically carry 7,200W (30 × 240). However, for continuous loads (including water heaters), NEC limits it to 80% — that's 5,760W maximum. Standard 4,500W and 5,500W water heaters fall comfortably within this limit."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I replace my water heater breaker myself?",
    answer: "Technically, many states allow homeowners to do their own electrical work with a permit. However, working inside an electrical panel is dangerous — you're exposed to 240V and potentially lethal currents. Unless you have electrical experience, hire a licensed electrician. Always turn off the main breaker before working in the panel."
