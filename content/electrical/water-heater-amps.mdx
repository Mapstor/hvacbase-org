# Water Heater Amps: How Many Amps Does a Water Heater Use?

**A standard electric tank water heater draws 18.75 amps at 240 volts (for a 4,500W element) or 22.9 amps (for a 5,500W element).** Tankless electric water heaters are power-hungry — drawing 33 to 150 amps depending on size. Heat pump water heaters draw only 2–3 amps during normal operation, making them the most efficient option.

Understanding your water heater's amp draw is essential for proper circuit sizing. An undersized circuit means nuisance breaker trips; an oversized breaker on undersized wire is a fire hazard.

## Water Heater Amp Draw Quick Reference

| Water Heater Type | Typical Amps | Circuit Required | Wire Gauge |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Tank (4,500W) | 18.75A | 30A / 240V | 10 AWG |
| Tank (5,500W) | 22.9A | 30A / 240V | 10 AWG |
| Tankless (18kW) | 75A total | 2 × 40A / 240V | 8 AWG each |
| Tankless (27kW) | 113A total | 3 × 40A / 240V | 8 AWG each |
| Heat pump (normal mode) | 2–3A | 30A / 240V | 10 AWG |
| Heat pump (backup mode) | 18.75A | 30A / 240V | 10 AWG |

## Tank Water Heater Amp Draw Chart

| Element Wattage | Voltage | Amps | Continuous Load (×1.25) | Breaker |
|-----------------|---------|------|-------------------------|---------|
| 1,500W | 240V | 6.25A | 7.8A | 15A DP |
| 2,500W | 240V | 10.4A | 13.0A | 15A DP |
| 3,000W | 240V | 12.5A | 15.6A | 20A DP |
| 4,000W | 240V | 16.7A | 20.8A | 25A DP |
| **4,500W** | **240V** | **18.75A** | **23.4A** | **30A DP** |
| **5,500W** | **240V** | **22.9A** | **28.6A** | **30A DP** |
| 6,000W | 240V | 25.0A | 31.3A | 40A DP |

<Callout type="important">
**The 4,500W / 18.75A configuration covers 80–90% of residential water heaters.** This applies to tanks from 30 to 80 gallons. If you don't know your specific wattage, 18.75A is a reliable estimate — but always verify from the data plate on your unit.

## Tankless Electric Water Heater Amps

Tankless units heat water instantly on demand, requiring massive power draws.

| Model kW | Total Amps | Circuits Needed | Amps per Circuit | Panel Load |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| 8 kW | 33A | 1 | 33A | 40A |
| 11 kW | 46A | 1 | 46A | 60A |
| 13 kW | 54A | 2 | 27A | 60A |
| 18 kW | 75A | 2 | 37.5A | 80A |
| 24 kW | 100A | 2 | 50A | 100A |
| 27 kW | 113A | 3 | 37.7A | 120A |
| 36 kW | 150A | 4 | 37.5A | 160A |

<Callout type="warning">
**Tankless electric water heaters can overwhelm residential panels.** A 27kW unit requires 113 amps — over half of a 200A panel. Many homes need a [panel upgrade](/electrical-panel-upgrade-cost) before installing tankless electric. Consider a heat pump water heater instead — same 30A circuit, far lower actual draw.

## Heat Pump Water Heater Amps

Heat pump water heaters use refrigeration technology to extract heat from surrounding air, dramatically reducing energy consumption.

| Operating Mode | Wattage | Amps at 240V | When Used |
|---------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Heat Pump Only | 500–600W | 2.1–2.5A | Normal operation, ambient >45°F |
| Hybrid | 500–4,500W | 2.1–18.75A | Auto-selects based on demand |
| Electric Only | 4,500W | 18.75A | High demand or cold ambient |
| High Demand | 4,500W | 18.75A | Rapid recovery needed |

**The key insight:** Heat pump water heaters are wired identically to standard tanks (30A circuit, 10 AWG wire) but draw only 2–3 amps during typical operation. The circuit is sized for the backup resistance element, which rarely activates.

## How to Calculate Your Water Heater's Amps

**Formula: Amps = Watts ÷ Volts**

**Example:** 4,500W water heater at 240V
4,500 ÷ 240 = **18.75 amps**

### Finding the Wattage

Look for the data plate on your water heater (usually near the upper thermostat access panel). It lists:
- **Watts (W):** Element wattage
- **Volts (V):** Operating voltage (240V)
- **Amps (A):** Sometimes listed directly

**Note:** If you see "4500/4500W" (dual elements), only one operates at a time. Size your circuit for single-element draw (4,500W), not combined.

## Amp Draw vs. Operating Cost

| Water Heater Type | Monthly kWh | Monthly Cost ($0.166/kWh) | Annual Cost |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Standard tank (4,500W) | 400–500 | $66–$83 | $797–$996 |
| High-efficiency tank | 350–420 | $58–$70 | $697–$837 |
| Heat pump (hybrid) | 130–180 | $22–$30 | $259–$359 |
| Tankless (18kW, moderate use) | 280–400 | $46–$66 | $558–$797 |

<Callout type="example">
**Cost comparison for a family of 4:**
- Standard tank: **$70/month** ($840/year)
- Heat pump water heater: **$26/month** ($312/year)
- **Annual savings: $528**

The heat pump pays for itself in 3–4 years through energy savings alone — faster with the $2,000 federal tax credit available through 2032.

## Dual Elements: A Common Confusion

Most residential water heaters have two heating elements (upper and lower), but they **never run simultaneously**. Here's how the sequencing works:

1. Cold water enters the tank
2. Upper element heats first (hot water rises to top for immediate use)
3. Upper thermostat satisfies, transfers power to lower element
4. Lower element heats the rest of the tank
5. Cycle repeats as hot water is used

**Circuit sizing:** Based on one element (4,500W = 18.75A), not both combined.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Verifying Circuit for Replacement

**Scenario:** Replacing a 50-gallon water heater. Existing circuit: 30A breaker, 10/2 NM-B.

**New water heater specs:** 4,500W, 240V

**Calculation:**
- Amps = 4,500 ÷ 240 = 18.75A
- With 1.25× factor: 18.75 × 1.25 = 23.4A
- Required breaker: 25A or 30A ✓

**Verdict:** Existing 30A circuit is correct. Compatible without changes.

### Example 2: Tankless vs. Heat Pump Decision

**Scenario:** Family wants to upgrade from standard tank. Current panel: 200A with 40A spare capacity.

**Option A: Tankless 27kW**
- Requires 113A (3 × 40A circuits)
- Exceeds 40A spare capacity
- Would need panel upgrade ($1,500–$4,000)

**Option B: Heat Pump**
- Requires 30A (one circuit)
- Draws only 2–3A normally
- Fits existing panel easily

**Best choice:** Heat pump — lower installation cost, lower operating cost, no panel upgrade.

### Example 3: Converting Gas to Electric

**Scenario:** Gas water heater failed; homeowner switching to electric 50-gallon tank.

**New circuit needed:**
- Breaker: 30A double-pole
- Wire: 10/2 NM-B
- Run: 35 feet from panel
- Panel spaces: 2 (for double-pole breaker)

**Cost:** $250–$500 professional installation (plus water heater)

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How many amps does a 50 gallon water heater use?",
    answer: "Most 50-gallon electric water heaters with 4,500W elements draw 18.75 amps at 240V. Some high-recovery models use 5,500W elements drawing 22.9 amps. Both configurations use a 30A breaker and 10 AWG wire. Check your unit's data plate for exact specifications."
  },
  {
    question: "How many amps does a tankless water heater use?",
    answer: "Tankless electric water heaters draw 33–150 amps depending on their kW rating. An 18kW unit draws 75A across two circuits. A 27kW whole-house unit draws 113A across three circuits. These are significantly higher than the 18.75A of a standard tank heater."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a water heater need a dedicated circuit?",
    answer: "Yes. Electric water heaters must be on a dedicated circuit per NEC requirements. No other appliances or outlets can share the circuit. This ensures the full breaker capacity is available for the water heater's continuous load."
  },
  {
    question: "Do both water heater elements run at the same time?",
    answer: "No. In standard residential water heaters, only one element operates at a time through a sequencing switch. The upper element heats first, then power transfers to the lower element. This is why a unit with two 4,500W elements still only needs a 30A (4,500W) circuit."
  },
  {
    question: "How many amps does a heat pump water heater use?",
    answer: "Heat pump water heaters draw only 2–3 amps during normal heat pump operation — far less than the 18.75A of a standard tank. They're wired with a 30A circuit to handle the backup resistance element (4,500W), which only activates during high-demand periods or cold ambient temperatures."
  },
  {
    question: "What size breaker do I need for a water heater?",
    answer: "Most residential water heaters need a 30-amp double-pole breaker. This handles the 18.75A draw of a 4,500W element with room for the 1.25× continuous load factor. Smaller point-of-use units may use 15A or 20A breakers; tankless requires multiple 40A–50A breakers."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my water heater keep tripping the breaker?",
    answer: "Common causes include: a faulty heating element shorting to ground, loose wire connections, a failing thermostat, water infiltration in the electrical compartment, or an undersized breaker for your element wattage. Have an electrician diagnose the issue — don't just reset repeatedly."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I run a water heater on a 15-amp circuit?",
    answer: "Only for very small point-of-use units under 2,500W. Standard 4,500W water heaters draw 18.75A and require a minimum 30A circuit. A 15A breaker would trip immediately and repeatedly with a standard water heater connected."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference in operating costs between water heater types?",
    answer: "Standard tanks cost approximately $70/month to operate. Heat pump water heaters cost about $25/month — a 60–70% savings. Tankless electric costs vary widely ($45–$90/month) based on usage patterns. Heat pumps offer the lowest operating cost with the same circuit requirements as standard tanks."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find my water heater's amp draw?",
    answer: "Check the data plate on the side of your water heater for watts (W) and volts (V). Calculate: Amps = Watts ÷ Volts. For a 4,500W unit at 240V: 4,500 ÷ 240 = 18.75A. Some data plates list amps directly. If the plate shows dual wattages (e.g., 4500/4500), use the single-element value."
