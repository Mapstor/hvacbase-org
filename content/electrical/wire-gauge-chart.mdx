# Wire Gauge Chart: AWG Wire Sizes & Ampacity (Complete 2026 Reference)

**The American Wire Gauge (AWG) system rates wire from 40 AWG (thinnest, 0.003 inches) to 4/0 AWG (thickest common residential, 0.460 inches), with smaller numbers indicating thicker wire and higher ampacity.** For residential wiring, 14 AWG carries up to 15 amps, 12 AWG handles 20 amps, 10 AWG supports 30 amps, and the scale continues up to 4/0 AWG at 195–230 amps depending on insulation temperature rating.

Below you'll find the most comprehensive AWG wire gauge charts available — covering copper and aluminum conductors across all three NEC temperature columns, physical dimensions, resistance values, and practical application guidance for every gauge you'll encounter in residential and light commercial work.

<TableOfContents />

## Master AWG Wire Gauge Chart — Copper Conductors

This is the complete reference table based on NEC Table 310.16 for copper conductors rated 0–2000 volts. These ampacity values apply to no more than 3 current-carrying conductors in a raceway or cable at an ambient temperature of 30°C (86°F).

| AWG | Diameter (in) | Area (kcmil) | 60°C (TW, UF) | 75°C (THW, THWN, XHHW) | 90°C (THHN, THWN-2, XHHW-2) | Typical Residential Use |

<Callout type="important">
**NEC 240.4(D) overrides these ampacity values for small branch circuits.** Regardless of insulation temperature rating, 14 AWG is capped at 15A, 12 AWG at 20A, and 10 AWG at 30A for branch circuit overcurrent protection. The higher ampacity values for 75°C and 90°C insulation apply only for derating calculations, not for breaker sizing.
</Callout>

## AWG Wire Gauge Chart — Aluminum Conductors

Aluminum conductors have approximately 61% the conductivity of copper, requiring larger gauges for equivalent ampacity. Modern AA-8000 series aluminum alloy (required by NEC 310.14 since 1972) is the standard for residential service entrance and feeder applications.

| AWG | Diameter (in) | Area (kcmil) | 60°C (TW, UF) | 75°C (THW, THWN, XHHW) | 90°C (THHN, THWN-2, XHHW-2) | Typical Use |

<Callout type="tip">
**Quick copper-to-aluminum conversion:** To get equivalent ampacity in aluminum, go up approximately 2 AWG sizes. For example, 6 AWG copper (55A at 60°C) is roughly equivalent to 4 AWG aluminum (55A at 60°C). This rule works well for sizes 4 AWG through 4/0 AWG.

## Wire Resistance Chart

Wire resistance determines voltage drop over distance. This is critical for long runs to HVAC equipment, detached garages, and outbuildings.

| AWG | Copper (Ω/1000 ft) | Aluminum (Ω/1000 ft) | Copper (Ω/km) | Aluminum (Ω/km) |
|-----|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|

## Wire Weight and Cost Comparison

Understanding cost helps you make practical decisions, especially for long runs where material costs add up.

| AWG | Copper Weight (lb/1000 ft) | Aluminum Weight (lb/1000 ft) | Copper NM-B Cost ($/ft, 2026 est.) | Aluminum SE Cost ($/ft, 2026 est.) |
|-----|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|

| 4/0 SE | — | 85.5 | — | $2.50–$4.00/cable |

<Callout type="info">
**Copper prices fluctuate significantly.** The prices above are estimates for early 2026. Copper commodity prices directly affect wire costs. In 2022–2024, copper surged above $4.50/lb, pushing 10/2 NM-B above $1.00/ft at retail. Check current pricing before budgeting large projects.
</Callout>

## Understanding Temperature Ratings

The three temperature columns in NEC Table 310.16 correspond to the insulation type on the wire. This matters more than most people realize.

### 60°C Column (TW, UF-B, NM-B)

This is the most conservative rating and what you use for standard Romex (NM-B) branch circuits. Even though NM-B cable actually contains 90°C-rated conductors, the cable assembly is rated at 60°C. For branch circuit breaker sizing under NEC 240.4(D), this column doesn't even matter — the breaker cap is more restrictive.

### 75°C Column (THW, THWN, XHHW, USE)

Used for individual conductors in conduit with 75°C insulation. This is common for HVAC equipment connections in conduit, service entrance wiring, and feeder circuits. Most terminal connections on equipment (breakers, disconnects, outlets) are rated for 75°C conductors.

### 90°C Column (THHN, THWN-2, XHHW-2)

The highest standard rating. You can use this column's ampacity for derating calculations (adjusting for ambient temperature or conduit fill), but the actual overcurrent protection must be based on the 75°C or 60°C column matching your termination temperature rating.

<Callout type="example">
**Practical example:** You're running 6 AWG THHN (90°C rated) through conduit with 4 current-carrying conductors. The 90°C ampacity is 75A, and the derating factor for 4 conductors is 80%. So: 75A × 0.80 = 60A. Since 60A is still above the 75°C column value of 65A — wait, it's below. So you'd use 60A as your effective ampacity. The breaker cannot exceed 60A.
</Callout>

## Ampacity Derating Factors

When multiple conductors share a raceway or cable, or when ambient temperature exceeds 30°C, you must derate the ampacity values.

### Conduit Fill Derating (NEC 310.15(C)(1))

| Number of Current-Carrying Conductors | Adjustment Factor |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1–3 | 100% (no derating) |
| 4–6 | 80% |
| 7–9 | 70% |
| 10–20 | 50% |
| 21–30 | 45% |
| 31–40 | 40% |
| 41+ | 35% |

### Ambient Temperature Correction (NEC Table 310.15(B)(1))

| Ambient Temp (°C) | Ambient Temp (°F) | 60°C Wire Factor | 75°C Wire Factor | 90°C Wire Factor |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 21–25 | 70–77 | 1.08 | 1.05 | 1.04 |
| 26–30 | 79–86 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| 31–35 | 88–95 | 0.91 | 0.94 | 0.96 |
| 36–40 | 97–104 | 0.82 | 0.88 | 0.91 |
| 41–45 | 106–113 | 0.71 | 0.82 | 0.87 |
| 46–50 | 115–122 | 0.58 | 0.75 | 0.82 |
| 51–55 | 124–131 | 0.41 | 0.67 | 0.76 |

<Callout type="warning">
**Attic runs in hot climates:** If you're running NM-B cable through an attic in Arizona or Texas where summer temperatures hit 60°C (140°F), the derating is severe. A 12 AWG copper conductor rated 20A at 30°C drops to just 11.6A at 60°C ambient with 60°C insulation. This is why HVAC wiring in hot attics often requires upsizing.

## How the AWG System Works

The AWG numbering system isn't arbitrary — it's based on the number of drawing dies the wire passes through during manufacturing. Each die reduces the diameter by a consistent ratio.

**The mathematical relationship:** Each step in AWG changes the diameter by a factor of 1.1229 (the 39th root of 92). Every 6 AWG steps doubles the diameter, and every 3 AWG steps doubles the cross-sectional area.

This means:
- **3 gauges smaller** (e.g., 10 to 7 AWG) = **2× cross-section area** = ~2× ampacity increase
- **6 gauges smaller** (e.g., 12 to 6 AWG) = **4× cross-section area** = ~2× diameter
- **10 gauges smaller** (e.g., 14 to 4 AWG) = **10× cross-section area**

The system goes from 40 AWG (0.003 inches, used in electronics) to 0 AWG (0.325 inches). Beyond 0 AWG, sizes are expressed as multiples of zero: 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, and 4/0 (pronounced "one-ought" through "four-ought"). Above 4/0, wire is measured in kcmil (thousands of circular mils) — 250, 300, 350 kcmil, etc.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Wiring a New Central AC Installation

**Scenario:** You're installing a Carrier 24ACC636A003 (3-ton, 16 SEER2). The nameplate reads: MCA 19.0A, MOP 30A, 208/230V, 1-phase.

**Wire sizing:**
- MCA of 19.0A → Need wire rated for ≥19.0A
- 10 AWG copper at 60°C = 30A ✓ (exceeds MCA)
- MOP of 30A → Breaker = 30A double-pole
- Run length: 45 feet from panel → Voltage drop: (2 × 45 × 19 × 1.24) / 1000 = 2.1V = 0.9% ✓

**Result:** 10/2 NM-B from panel to disconnect, 10 AWG THHN in flex conduit from disconnect to unit, 30A double-pole breaker.

### Example 2: Adding an EV Charger to an Existing Home

**Scenario:** You want to install a 48-amp Tesla Wall Connector in the garage, 60 feet from the panel.

**Wire sizing:**
- 48A continuous load → 48A × 1.25 = 60A breaker required (80% rule)
- 60A breaker requires minimum 6 AWG copper (55A at 60°C... wait, that's only 55A)
- Since the breaker is 60A and 6 AWG at 60°C is 55A, you need to verify: NEC allows 6 AWG on a 60A breaker because the next standard breaker size above 55A is 60A (NEC 240.4(B))
- Voltage drop at 60 ft, 48A, 6 AWG: (2 × 60 × 48 × 0.491) / 1000 = 2.83V = 1.2% ✓

**Result:** 6/2 NM-B or 6 AWG THHN in conduit, 60A double-pole breaker.

### Example 3: Feeding a Detached Garage Sub-Panel

**Scenario:** You want a 60A sub-panel in a detached garage 120 feet from the main panel.

**Wire sizing:**
- 60A feeder → 6 AWG copper minimum (55A at 60°C, acceptable per NEC 240.4(B))
- Voltage drop at 120 ft, 60A, 6 AWG: (2 × 120 × 60 × 0.491) / 1000 = 7.06V = 2.9% on 240V ✓
- Need 4 wires: 2 hots + neutral + ground (separate building requires local grounding electrode)
- Underground run → Use THWN conductors in PVC conduit or direct-burial UF cable

**Result:** 6 AWG copper THWN in 1" PVC conduit (4 conductors), 60A double-pole breaker at main panel, ground rod at garage.

### Example 4: Wiring a Tankless Water Heater

**Scenario:** Installing a Rheem RTEX-18 tankless water heater (18kW, 240V). It requires 2 × 40A circuits.

**Wire sizing per circuit:**
- 18kW ÷ 2 circuits = 9kW per circuit → 9,000W ÷ 240V = 37.5A per circuit
- Continuous load: 37.5A × 1.25 = 46.9A → 50A breaker per circuit
- 50A breaker → 6 AWG copper minimum
- Two separate 6/2 NM-B cables, each on a 50A double-pole breaker

**Result:** Two 6/2 NM-B cables, two 50A double-pole breakers, taking up 4 panel spaces total. This is why tankless electric water heaters often require a panel upgrade.

## Key Takeaways

<Callout type="takeaway">
- **14 AWG = 15A, 12 AWG = 20A, 10 AWG = 30A** — these NEC 240.4(D) caps are non-negotiable for branch circuits
- **Use NEC Table 310.16** as your primary reference — the 60°C column for NM-B cable, 75°C for THWN in conduit
- **Aluminum requires upsizing ~2 AWG** compared to copper for equivalent ampacity
- **Calculate voltage drop** on any run over 50 feet — the 3% branch circuit limit catches many installations
- **Temperature derating** is critical for attic runs in hot climates and conduits with multiple conductors
- **Always verify equipment nameplate** — MCA determines wire size, MOP determines breaker size
- **Copper costs 40–60% more than aluminum** per amp of capacity — use aluminum for service entrance and large feeders where code allows

    question: "What size wire do I need for 50 amps?",
    answer: "For a 50-amp circuit, you need 6 AWG copper wire (55A at 60°C, 65A at 75°C) or 4 AWG aluminum wire (55A at 60°C). For runs over 80 feet, consider upsizing to 4 AWG copper to keep voltage drop under 3%."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use aluminum wire for branch circuits?",
    answer: "The NEC permits aluminum wire for branch circuits, but it's uncommon and not recommended for residential 15A and 20A circuits due to the need for special CO/ALR-rated devices and anti-oxidant compound. Aluminum is standard and fully safe for service entrance conductors and feeder circuits of 6 AWG and larger."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I determine wire size for a long run?",
    answer: "Calculate voltage drop using the formula VD = (2 × L × I × R) / 1000, where L is one-way length in feet, I is current in amps, and R is wire resistance per 1,000 feet. If voltage drop exceeds 3% on the branch circuit, upsize the wire. For total drop (feeder + branch), keep it under 5%."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between stranded and solid wire?",
    answer: "Solid wire (one thick conductor) is standard in 14 AWG through 10 AWG NM-B cable. Stranded wire (multiple thin conductors twisted together) is used in 8 AWG and larger sizes for flexibility. Both have identical ampacity ratings per NEC Table 310.16. Stranded wire is easier to pull through conduit and bend at connections."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the NEC have three temperature columns?",
    answer: "The three columns (60°C, 75°C, 90°C) correspond to the insulation temperature rating of the wire. Higher-rated insulation allows more current because the wire can safely operate at higher temperatures. However, the weakest link in the circuit determines the usable rating — if your terminations (breaker, outlet) are rated for 75°C, you use the 75°C column even if the wire is rated for 90°C."

  {
    question: "What does 'kcmil' mean in wire sizing?",
    answer: "Kcmil stands for 'thousands of circular mils' — a circular mil being the area of a circle with a 1-mil (0.001 inch) diameter. Wire sizes above 4/0 AWG are expressed in kcmil: 250 kcmil, 300 kcmil, etc. For context, 4/0 AWG equals 211.6 kcmil. This measurement system is standard for large conductors used in commercial and industrial applications."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know what temperature rating my wire has?",
    answer: "The insulation type is printed on the wire jacket every few feet. Common residential types: NM-B (60°C assembly rating), THHN (90°C dry), THWN (75°C wet), THWN-2 (90°C wet/dry), XHHW-2 (90°C). Check the printed markings — they'll show something like '12 AWG THHN 90°C 600V'."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to derate wire in a hot attic?",
    answer: "Yes. NEC 310.15(B)(1) requires ampacity correction when ambient temperature exceeds 30°C (86°F). Attics in hot climates can reach 60°C (140°F) or higher. At 60°C ambient, a 60°C-rated wire loses 42% of its ampacity — 12 AWG NM-B drops from 20A to just 11.6A. For HVAC wiring in hot attics, either upsize the wire or use conduit with higher-rated conductors."
  },
  {
    question: "What gauge wire is used for 200-amp service?",
    answer: "A 200-amp residential service typically uses 2/0 AWG copper (145A at 60°C, but rated for 200A service per NEC 310.12) or 4/0 AWG aluminum (150A at 60°C, but accepted for 200A service). Most homes use aluminum SE cable because it costs roughly half as much as copper at these sizes."
