# How to Vent a Portable AC Without a Window (5 Methods)

You can vent a portable air conditioner without a standard window by using a sliding glass door, drop ceiling, through-wall vent, existing dryer vent, or a modified casement/crank window setup. Each method requires routing the 5-inch diameter exhaust hose to an opening that leads outside or into an unconditioned space — the hot air has to go somewhere or the AC won't cool your room.

Below, you'll find step-by-step instructions for all five methods, including tools needed, estimated cost, and the pros and cons of each approach.

<TableOfContents />

## Why Venting Is Non-Negotiable

Before we get into the methods, let's be clear: you cannot skip venting. A portable AC in cooling mode exhausts hot air (110°F–140°F) through its hose. If that air stays in your room, the net result is heating, not cooling. The compressor generates approximately 3,400 BTU of heat per 1,000 watts consumed, and without an exhaust path, all of that heat stays indoors.

The only modes that work without venting are fan-only (no cooling) and dehumidifier (removes moisture but adds heat). For actual cooling, you need one of these five exhaust solutions.

## Method 1: Sliding Glass Door (Easiest)

**Difficulty:** Easy | **Cost:** $25–$80 | **Time:** 20–40 minutes

Sliding glass doors are the most common windowless venting solution. The approach is simple: fill the gap left by a partially opened door with a panel, and cut a hole for the exhaust hose.

### What You Need

- Portable AC sliding door kit ($30–$60) OR plexiglass/foam board sheet ($15–$25)
- Foam weatherstripping tape ($5–$10)
- Measuring tape
- Utility knife or jigsaw
- 5" or 6" hose adapter (if not included with kit)

### Step-by-Step

**Step 1:** Measure the height of your sliding door opening. Standard heights are 79"–82" for 6'8" doors or 95"–98" for 8' doors.

**Step 2:** If using a commercial kit, it typically includes a telescoping panel that adjusts to your door height. Install it in the door track with the hose connector hole at the desired height (typically 2–3 feet from the floor).

**Step 3:** If building your own panel, cut plexiglass or rigid foam insulation board to fit the opening. Cut a 5"–6" diameter hole about 2 feet from the bottom for the exhaust hose. For dual-hose units, cut two holes.

**Step 4:** Apply foam weatherstripping around all edges of the panel to seal against the door frame and the sliding door. This prevents hot air from re-entering.

**Step 5:** Secure the panel. Some people use a C-clamp at the top, a dowel rod in the door track (as a security bar), or screws through the panel into the door frame (if allowed).

**Step 6:** Connect the exhaust hose to the panel's hose adapter.

<Callout type="tip">
**Security concern:** A foam or thin plastic panel in your sliding door is easy to push through from outside. Add a secondary security measure like a door bar, Charlie bar, or motion sensor alarm. A piece of 3/4" plywood cut to the same size is more secure but heavier and harder to store.
</Callout>

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| No permanent modifications | Reduces door usability |
| Easy to install and remove | Sliding door panel is a security weak point |
| Commercial kits widely available | Panel may not insulate well (hot to the touch) |
| Works for all portable AC types | Tall doors may be hard to seal completely |

## Method 2: Drop Ceiling / Suspended Ceiling

**Difficulty:** Moderate | **Cost:** $15–$50 | **Time:** 30–60 minutes

Common in offices, basements, and commercial spaces, drop ceilings provide an excellent venting path. The space above the ceiling tiles (the plenum) typically connects to unconditioned space.

### What You Need

- 5" flexible aluminum duct ($10–$20 for 8 feet)
- Ceiling tile with 5" hole (modify existing or buy blank)
- Hose clamps ($3–$5)
- Duct tape (for extra sealing)

### Step-by-Step

**Step 1:** Identify a ceiling tile near the portable AC's location. Ideally, choose one directly above or within 4 feet of the unit.

**Step 2:** Remove the tile and inspect the plenum space. You're looking for it to vent to an unconditioned area — above the ceiling to an exterior wall, an attic space, or a return air path. Avoid venting into a space that's sealed (the heat has nowhere to go) or into shared office spaces.

**Step 3:** Cut a 5"–6" hole in the center of the ceiling tile.

**Step 4:** Attach a duct adapter or connect flexible aluminum duct directly to the ceiling tile hole. The duct should extend at least 2 feet into the plenum to prevent hot air from falling back through the tile.

**Step 5:** Connect the portable AC's exhaust hose to the duct adapter below the ceiling tile.

**Step 6:** Seal the modified tile back into the grid. Use foam tape around the edges if the tile doesn't sit flush.

<Callout type="warning">
**Check your building codes and lease.** In commercial buildings, the plenum space may be part of the HVAC return air system. Venting hot, humid air into a plenum that feeds the building's air handler can cause problems. Check with your building manager. In server rooms or IT spaces, this method is common and generally acceptable.
</Callout>

### Temperature Considerations

The plenum space will warm up. In a sealed plenum, continuous portable AC use can raise the temperature above the ceiling to 90°F–110°F, potentially affecting ceiling tiles (sagging) and any equipment or wiring above. Ensure the plenum has some ventilation or connection to a larger unconditioned space.

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| No window or wall modification needed | Must check building codes |
| Invisible from outside | Plenum can overheat in sealed spaces |
| Works in offices and commercial spaces | May affect building HVAC system |
| Easy to remove and restore | Ceiling tiles can sag from heat |

## Method 3: Through-Wall Vent

**Difficulty:** Hard | **Cost:** $50–$200 | **Time:** 2–4 hours

A through-wall vent is the most permanent and effective non-window solution. It creates a dedicated exhaust path directly to the outside, just like a dryer vent.

### What You Need

- 5"–6" wall vent cap with damper ($15–$30)
- 5" rigid or flexible duct ($10–$15)
- Core drill bit or hole saw (5"–6") ($20–$40 to rent)
- Drill/hammer drill
- Silicone caulk ($5–$10)
- Stud finder ($15–$25 if not owned)

### Step-by-Step

**Step 1:** Choose a wall location near the portable AC. It must be an exterior wall. Use a stud finder to locate and avoid studs, electrical wiring, and plumbing. The hole should be 2–3 feet above floor level.

**Step 2:** Drill a pilot hole from inside to outside to confirm the exit point. Check the exterior for obstacles (electrical panels, gas lines, windows, siding irregularities).

**Step 3:** Core drill or hole-saw a 5"–6" hole through the wall from inside. For brick or concrete, you'll need a masonry core drill bit and a hammer drill. For wood-frame walls with siding, a standard hole saw works.

**Step 4:** Install a duct sleeve (rigid duct section) through the wall. Slope it slightly downward toward the exterior (1/4" per foot) so any condensation drains outside.

**Step 5:** On the exterior, install the vent cap with a damper (prevents backdraft when the AC is off). Seal around the cap with silicone caulk.

**Step 6:** On the interior, connect the portable AC's exhaust hose to the wall duct using a hose adapter. Seal with foil tape.

**Step 7:** When the AC isn't in use, cap the interior opening or use the damper's closure feature.

**Renters:** This method typically requires landlord permission and may not be allowed. It's best suited for homeowners or commercial spaces. If you're renting, consider Methods 1, 2, or 5 instead.
</Callout>

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Most efficient exhaust path | Permanent wall modification |
| Clean look (no window clutter) | Requires tools and skills |
| Works with any room layout | Not suitable for renters |
| Best seal quality | Must avoid utilities in wall |

## Method 4: Existing Dryer Vent

**Difficulty:** Easy–Moderate | **Cost:** $10–$40 | **Time:** 15–30 minutes

If your room has a dryer vent that's accessible, you can temporarily repurpose it for your portable AC. This works especially well in apartment laundry rooms or bedrooms that share a wall with a laundry area.

### What You Need

- 5" to 4" duct reducer ($5–$10) — most dryer vents are 4" while portable AC hoses are 5"
- Foil duct tape ($5–$8)
- Hose clamp ($3)

### Step-by-Step

**Step 1:** Disconnect your dryer's exhaust hose from the wall vent. (You can't use both simultaneously.)

**Step 2:** Attach the 5" to 4" reducer to the portable AC's exhaust hose.

**Step 3:** Connect the reducer to the dryer vent opening in the wall. Secure with a hose clamp and seal with foil duct tape.

**Step 4:** Check the exterior dryer vent flap to ensure it opens freely when the AC runs.

**Step 5:** When switching back to dryer use, disconnect the AC hose and reconnect the dryer vent.

<Callout type="warning">
**The 5" to 4" reduction creates backpressure.** Your portable AC exhaust hose is 5" diameter, but most dryer vents are 4". This reduction can increase exhaust backpressure and reduce your AC's efficiency by 5%–10%. It's not ideal for continuous heavy use, but works well for occasional or supplemental cooling.
</Callout>

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Uses existing infrastructure | Can't use dryer and AC simultaneously |
| No wall modifications | 5" to 4" reduction reduces efficiency |
| Quick swap between dryer and AC | Dryer vent may be in wrong room |
| Low cost | Vent flap may restrict airflow |

## Method 5: Casement / Crank / Awning Window Adapter

**Difficulty:** Moderate | **Cost:** $30–$100 | **Time:** 30–60 minutes

Casement (crank-out), awning (push-out), and hopper windows don't accept standard portable AC window kits. But with a custom panel, you can make them work.

### What You Need

- Rigid foam insulation board or plexiglass (1/2"–3/4" thick)
- Foam weatherstripping tape
- 5" or 6" dryer-style wall vent ($10–$15)
- Utility knife or jigsaw
- Measuring tape

### Step-by-Step

**Step 1:** Open the casement/awning window fully. Measure the opening dimensions carefully.

**Step 2:** Cut your panel material to fit the window opening exactly. Use rigid foam insulation board (R-5 to R-8) for better insulating properties, or plexiglass for durability and appearance.

**Step 3:** Cut a 5"–6" hole near the bottom of the panel for the exhaust hose. For dual-hose units, cut two holes.

**Step 4:** Install a dryer-style vent with a damper in the hole (helps prevent backdraft when the AC is off).

**Step 5:** Apply weatherstripping tape around all edges of the panel.

**Step 6:** Press the panel into the window opening. For casement windows, the window handle/crank mechanism may need the panel to be notched. Secure with foam wedges or clips.

**Step 7:** Connect the exhaust hose to the interior side of the vent adapter.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example: 1920s Apartment with Casement Windows**
Amy's Chicago apartment has 40-year-old casement windows that are 15" wide × 48" tall. No commercial kit fits. She cut a 1/2" plexiglass panel to size, drilled a 5" hole, installed a dryer vent cap, and sealed everything with foam tape. Total cost: $45 in materials. The setup takes 10 minutes to install each spring and remove each fall. She's used it for 3 cooling seasons without issues.

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Works with non-standard windows | Custom fabrication required |
| Removable — no permanent mods | May not seal as well as standard kits |
| Relatively inexpensive | Panel may not match window aesthetic |
| Good insulation with foam board | Casement hardware can complicate fit |

## Method Comparison Summary

| Method | Cost | Difficulty | Renter-Friendly | Efficiency Impact | Best For |
|--------|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Sliding door | $25–$80 | Easy | Yes | Minimal | Apartments with balconies |
| Drop ceiling | $15–$50 | Moderate | Maybe | 5%–10% loss (plenum heat) | Offices, basements |
| Through-wall | $50–$200 | Hard | No | Best (direct exhaust) | Homeowners, permanent setup |
| Dryer vent | $10–$40 | Easy | Yes | 5%–10% loss (size reduction) | Rooms near laundry |
| Casement adapter | $30–$100 | Moderate | Yes | Minimal | Non-standard windows |

## Key Takeaways

- **You must vent your portable AC** — an unvented unit heats your room instead of cooling it.
- **Sliding door kits are the easiest non-window solution** — $30–$60, 20 minutes, renter-friendly.
- **Drop ceilings work great for offices** — vent into the plenum space above, but check building codes.
- **Through-wall vents are the best permanent solution** — direct exhaust, best efficiency, but requires wall modification.
- **Existing dryer vents are a clever repurpose** — just swap hoses between dryer and AC use.
- **Casement window adapters require custom panels** — use plexiglass or rigid foam insulation.
- **Always seal gaps with weatherstripping** — every method benefits from a tight seal.
- **Security matters** — sliding door panels and foam inserts need secondary locks or security measures.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "Can I vent a portable AC into another room?",
    answer: "You can, but it defeats the purpose. You'd be cooling one room while heating the adjacent one by the same amount (plus the compressor's waste heat). The only scenario where this makes sense is if the receiving room is unoccupied and has its own ventilation to the outside, or if you're intentionally trying to heat that space."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I vent a portable AC into the attic?",
    answer: "Yes, if your attic has adequate ventilation (soffit vents, ridge vents, gable vents). A well-ventilated attic can handle the exhaust heat — it naturally vents to the outside. However, if your attic is sealed or poorly ventilated, the accumulated heat and moisture can cause problems: overheating stored items, ice dam risk in winter if moisture lingers, and reduced insulation effectiveness."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I vent a portable AC through a chimney?",
    answer: "Generally not recommended. Most chimneys don't draw well in summer (no temperature differential to create draft), so the hot air may not exit efficiently. The exhaust hose also can't create a tight seal in a chimney opening. If you must, insert the hose into the chimney opening and seal around it with a chimney balloon or foam board. Ensure the damper is fully open."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the maximum distance I can vent a portable AC?",
    answer: "Keep the exhaust hose as short as possible — typically the manufacturer-provided length of 5–7 feet. Every additional foot of hose, every bend, and every transition fitting increases backpressure and reduces cooling efficiency by 2%–5% per foot. Beyond 10 feet, most portable ACs lose significant performance. Never extend beyond 12 feet total."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I vent through a garage?",
    answer: "Only if the garage is detached or you leave the garage door partially open. Venting into a closed attached garage raises the garage temperature (potentially damaging stored items and vehicles) and can push hot air back into your house through the garage-house door. An open or detached garage effectively works like venting outside."
  },
  {
    question: "Will a portable AC work in a basement without windows?",
    answer: "Yes, if you use one of the alternative venting methods. Drop ceiling venting is the most common for basements. You can also vent through a basement wall (below grade may require a window well modification), through an existing dryer vent, or up through the floor into an above-grade room with window access. Some basements have small hopper windows that work with casement adapter panels."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it safe to vent through a wall?",
    answer: "Yes, when done properly. It's the same concept as a dryer vent. Use a proper vent cap with a damper on the exterior, slope the duct slightly downward toward the outside for condensation drainage, seal with silicone caulk to prevent water intrusion, and ensure you avoid electrical wiring, plumbing, and structural members when drilling."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a longer hose than the one included?",
    answer: "Manufacturers strongly advise against it. The included hose length (typically 5–7 feet) is designed to match the unit's exhaust fan capacity. A longer hose increases backpressure, which makes the exhaust fan work harder, reduces airflow, and can cause the condenser coil to overheat. If you must extend, keep the total under 10 feet and use the same diameter or larger."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I can't vent outside at all?",
    answer: "If no exhaust path to the outside or an unconditioned space exists, a portable AC won't cool your room. Your alternatives are: evaporative cooler (works without venting but only in dry climates), fans with ice (temporary and ineffective for real cooling), or a ductless mini-split (requires a small 3-inch hole in an exterior wall for refrigerant lines — much smaller than a portable AC exhaust hole)."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the vent method affect cooling performance?",
    answer: "Slightly. A through-wall vent provides the most direct exhaust path and best performance. A sliding door panel or casement adapter performs nearly as well if properly sealed. Drop ceiling venting may lose 5%–10% if the plenum space gets hot. Dryer vent adaptation loses 5%–10% due to the 5-to-4-inch diameter reduction. The differences are minor compared to not venting at all."
