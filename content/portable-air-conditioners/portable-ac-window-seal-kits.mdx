# Best Window Seal Kits for Portable ACs (DIY Install)

The best portable AC window seal kit is the Gulrear Adjustable Window Seal Plate ($25–$35), which replaces the flimsy plastic panels included with most units. A proper window seal can improve your portable AC's effective cooling by 20%–40% by preventing hot outdoor air from infiltrating around the exhaust hose connection. The stock kits that come with portable ACs are the single weakest point in the entire system.

Here are the top kits for every window type, plus DIY options that outperform anything you can buy.

<TableOfContents />

## Why Stock Window Kits Are Bad

The plastic window panels included with portable ACs have three major problems. They're thin (1–2mm) and transfer heat through the panel itself. They have gaps where the panels meet and at the window frame edges. They bow and flex in wind, creating air leaks.

Measured tests show that stock kits allow 15%–30% more air infiltration than aftermarket foam or rigid kits. In real terms, that means your AC works harder to overcome the warm outdoor air seeping through gaps — running longer, consuming more electricity, and cooling less effectively.

### Infiltration Rates by Kit Type

| Kit Type | Air Infiltration (CFM) | Temperature Penalty | Efficiency Loss |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------| 
| No kit (open window) | 50–100+ CFM | AC can't cool | 100% |
| Stock plastic panel kit | 5–15 CFM | +3°F–+5°F | 15%–30% |
| Aftermarket foam seal kit | 1–4 CFM | +1°F–+2°F | 5%–10% |
| Rigid plexiglass/foam board | 0.5–2 CFM | +0.5°F–+1°F | 2%–5% |
| Custom plexiglass + weatherstrip | <0.5 CFM | Negligible | <2% |

The difference between a stock plastic kit and a custom plexiglass setup is significant — potentially 25% better cooling efficiency.

## Top 5 Window Seal Kits for 2026

### 1. Gulrear Adjustable Window Seal Plate — Best Overall

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Material | ABS plastic, 6mm thick |
| Window width | Adjustable 25"–62" |
| Hose openings | 1 or 2 (dual-hose compatible) |
| Insulation rating | Moderate (better than stock) |
| Seal type | Foam tape edges included |
| Price | $25–$35 |

Gulrear's kit is significantly thicker than stock panels (6mm vs. 1–2mm), with built-in foam tape on all edges. The adjustable width fits most horizontal sliding and double-hung windows. The pre-cut hose opening accepts standard 5" and 5.9" exhaust hoses with an included adapter ring.

Setup takes 10 minutes. The kit stays in the window track without tools — foam friction pads hold it in place. Dual-hose compatible with the 2-opening version.

**Best for:** Most sliding and double-hung windows, quick install, dual-hose units.

### 2. Brosyda Window Seal Kit with Fabric Panel — Best for Wide Windows

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Material | Nylon fabric + hook-and-loop tape |
| Window width | Up to 90" |
| Hose openings | 1 (expandable with additional zipper) |
| Insulation rating | Low (single-layer fabric) |
| Seal type | Velcro adhesive strips |
| Price | $15–$22 |

For oversized windows wider than 62", the Brosyda fabric kit is the most practical option. The nylon panel attaches to the window frame with adhesive Velcro strips, creating a seal around the entire window opening. A zippered opening accommodates the exhaust hose.

The fabric is less insulating than rigid panels, so expect some heat transfer through the material. But it seals against air infiltration well when the Velcro adhesive is properly applied. The kit is also washable.

**Best for:** Windows wider than 62", non-standard shapes, casement windows.

### 3. Forestchill Sliding Door Seal Kit — Best for Patio Doors

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Material | ABS plastic panels, telescoping |
| Door height | Adjustable 67"–80" (6'8" standard) and 78"–93" (8' version) |
| Hose openings | 1 (dual-hose version available) |
| Insulation rating | Moderate |
| Seal type | Foam tape + compression fit |
| Price | $35–$55 |

The Forestchill fills the gap left by a partially opened sliding glass door with a telescoping rigid panel. The hose connection is positioned at the bottom for optimal exhaust flow. The panel is thick enough to provide decent insulation, and the foam tape edges seal against the door frame.

The 8' version accommodates taller modern patio doors common in newer apartments. A security bar slot is built into the panel's design.

**Best for:** Apartments with sliding glass doors, no-window rooms.

### 4. AC-Safe Universal Window Seal — Best Budget

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Material | Foam insulation board, 1" thick |
| Window width | Cut to fit (any size) |
| Hose openings | You cut them |
| Insulation rating | Good (R-5) |
| Seal type | Compression fit + included tape |
| Price | $12–$18 |

The AC-Safe kit is a pre-scored foam insulation board that you cut to fit your window. At 1" thick with an R-5 insulation value, it outperforms every thin plastic panel on heat transfer. You cut the hose opening with a utility knife.

It's not as polished-looking as the hard plastic kits, but it seals better and insulates better for less money. The downside: it's single-use — once cut to fit one window, it can't easily be adjusted for another.

**Best for:** Budget buyers, maximum insulation, homeowners who won't move the setup.

### 5. Custom DIY Plexiglass Panel — Best Performance

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Material | 1/4" acrylic plexiglass |
| Window width | Custom cut to exact dimensions |
| Hose openings | Drilled to specification |
| Insulation rating | Moderate (clear) to High (with added foam layer) |
| Seal type | Foam weatherstripping, custom fitted |
| Price | $20–$50 (materials) |

A custom plexiglass panel cut to your exact window dimensions, with drilled hose openings and foam weatherstripping around all edges, is the best-performing window seal available. It creates an essentially airtight seal with zero flex or bowing.

**Materials needed:** 1/4" acrylic sheet ($15–$30 at Home Depot/Lowes), 5" hole saw ($8–$12), foam weatherstripping tape ($5–$8), and optionally a dryer vent cap with damper ($8–$12) for the hose opening.

**How to build it:**

1. Measure your window opening precisely (width and height of the gap you need to fill).
2. Have the acrylic cut to size at the hardware store (most cut for free) or score-and-snap at home.
3. Drill a 5" hole for the exhaust hose using a hole saw. For dual-hose, drill two holes.
4. Optionally install a dryer vent cap in the hole for a tight hose connection and backdraft prevention.
5. Apply foam weatherstripping tape around all four edges.
6. Press-fit into the window opening.

Total time: 30–60 minutes. Cost: $25–$50. Performance: better than any commercial kit.

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro tip: add a reflective layer.** Adhere reflective window film or aluminum tape to the exterior surface of your plexiglass panel. This reflects solar radiation instead of absorbing it, keeping the panel (and the air behind it) cooler. This small addition can reduce heat gain through the panel by 40%–60%.

| Kit | Air Seal (1–10) | Insulation (1–10) | Ease of Install | Dual-Hose? | Price |
|-----|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Stock plastic panel | 3 | 2 | 10 (included) | Some | Free |
| Gulrear Adjustable | 7 | 5 | 8 | Yes | $25–$35 |
| Brosyda Fabric | 6 | 3 | 7 | With mod | $15–$22 |
| Forestchill Door Kit | 7 | 5 | 7 | Yes option | $35–$55 |
| AC-Safe Foam Board | 8 | 8 | 6 | DIY cut | $12–$18 |
| Custom Plexiglass | 10 | 6–9 | 5 | Yes | $20–$50 |

## Installation Tips for Any Kit

**Always add extra foam tape.** Even good aftermarket kits have gaps at joints and edges. A $5 roll of self-adhesive foam weatherstripping tape applied to every seam dramatically improves seal quality.

**Seal the hose connection point.** The junction between the exhaust hose and the window kit is often the leakiest spot. Wrap the hose connector with foam tape for a friction fit, or use a hose clamp for a tight connection.

**Address the window track gaps.** If your window doesn't close fully against the panel (common with double-hung windows), the gap between the window sash and the panel is a major infiltration point. Fill it with foam tape, a pool noodle, or a rolled towel.

**Secure the panel.** Wind pressure can push flimsy panels inward, breaking the seal. C-clamps at the top, a wedge in the window track, or screws through the panel into the window frame (homeowners only) prevent this.

**Example 1: ROI of Upgrading From Stock Kit**
Mike replaced his stock plastic window kit with a custom plexiglass panel ($35 in materials). His portable AC's compressor runtime dropped from roughly 78% to about 62% of each hour — a 20% reduction. At $0.17/kWh, this saved about $8/month in electricity. The panel paid for itself in under 5 months.

**Example 2: Sliding Door in a High-Rise**
Apartment renter Yuki in a 22nd-floor condo with a 80" sliding glass door used the Forestchill kit ($48) to vent her portable AC. Without the kit, she'd been leaving the door cracked open 5" — hot wind on the 22nd floor was overwhelming the AC. The kit sealed the opening, and her room temperature dropped 6°F within an hour of installation.

**Example 3: Maximum DIY Seal**
An HVAC engineer built the ultimate window seal: 1/4" plexiglass with reflective film on the exterior, 1/2" rigid foam insulation on the interior side, foam weatherstripping on all edges, dryer vent caps with dampers for both hose openings (dual-hose setup), and silicone caulk on all permanent joints. Total cost: $65. He measured near-zero air infiltration with a smoke pencil test. His portable AC's measured CEER improved by 18% compared to the stock kit.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "Do I really need a window seal kit upgrade?",
    answer: "If you use your portable AC regularly (more than 2 weeks per year), yes. The stock plastic panels allow significant hot air infiltration that makes your unit work harder. A $15–$35 upgrade can reduce energy waste by 15%–30% and improve your room's cooling by several degrees. It's the highest-ROI upgrade for any portable AC setup."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a window seal kit with a casement window?",
    answer: "Not standard kits designed for sliding windows. For casement (crank) windows, use a fabric seal kit (Brosyda or similar) that adheres to the window frame with Velcro, or build a custom rigid panel cut to fit the casement opening. The custom panel approach works best for casement and awning windows."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I seal a portable AC for a sliding glass door?",
    answer: "Use a dedicated sliding door kit like the Forestchill ($35–$55), which fills the gap left by a partially opened door with a rigid telescoping panel. The panel includes a hose connection and foam tape edges. For a tighter seal, add a security bar and extra foam weatherstripping."
  },
  {
    question: "Will a window seal kit work with a dual-hose portable AC?",
    answer: "Most kits are designed for single-hose units. For dual-hose, look for kits specifically labeled 'dual-hose compatible' with two hose openings (Gulrear makes one). Alternatively, build a custom panel with two drilled holes — any rigid panel material works."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can a better window seal save on electricity?",
    answer: "Typically 10%–25% reduction in electricity use. For a unit that costs $50/month to run, that's $5–$12.50/month in savings. Over a 4-month cooling season, a $25 seal kit saves $20–$50 — paying for itself within the first season."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I make a permanent window seal for my portable AC?",
    answer: "Yes. For homeowners, a plexiglass panel can be screwed into the window frame with silicone caulk for a permanent, weathertight seal. Add a dryer vent cap with a damper to close off the opening when the AC isn't in use. This creates the best possible seal but obviously prevents normal use of that window section."
  },
  {
    question: "What about window seal kits for vertical sliding windows?",
    answer: "Most adjustable kits work with vertical sliding (double-hung) windows by installing horizontally in the window opening. The Gulrear and AC-Safe kits both accommodate horizontal installation. For tall, narrow gaps, a foam board cut to size may be easier than an adjustable panel."
  },
  {
    question: "Do window seal kits block bugs and rain?",
    answer: "Better than stock kits, but not perfectly. A well-sealed kit with foam tape prevents most insects. For rain protection, angle the exhaust hose slightly downward and consider a dryer vent cap with a built-in rain shield. During heavy storms, check for water intrusion around the seal edges."
