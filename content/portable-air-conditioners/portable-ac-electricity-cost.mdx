# How Much Electricity Does a Portable AC Use? (Cost Calc)

A typical 10,000 DOE BTU portable AC draws 1,000–1,200 watts and costs $0.15–$0.22 per hour to run at the national average electricity rate of $0.17/kWh. That works out to $1.20–$1.76 per day (8 hours), $36–$53 per month, and $180–$265 per cooling season (4 months). Your actual cost depends on three things: the unit's wattage, your electricity rate, and how many hours you run it.

Below you'll find detailed cost tables for every BTU size, a calculator for your exact setup, and strategies to cut your portable AC electricity bill by 20%–40%.

<TableOfContents />

## The Simple Cost Formula

**Hourly cost = (Watts ÷ 1,000) × Your electricity rate per kWh**

For example: A 1,100W portable AC at $0.17/kWh costs (1,100 ÷ 1,000) × $0.17 = **$0.187 per hour**.

Multiply by hours per day, days per month, and months per season for larger timeframes.

## Cost by BTU Size

| DOE BTU Rating | Typical Wattage | Hourly Cost ($0.17/kWh) | Daily (8 hrs) | Monthly (30 days) | Seasonal (120 days) |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 5,000–6,000 | 600–750W | $0.10–$0.13 | $0.82–$1.02 | $24–$31 | $98–$122 |
| 7,000–8,000 | 750–950W | $0.13–$0.16 | $1.02–$1.29 | $31–$39 | $122–$154 |
| 8,000–10,000 | 950–1,200W | $0.16–$0.20 | $1.29–$1.63 | $39–$49 | $154–$196 |
| 10,000–12,000 | 1,100–1,350W | $0.19–$0.23 | $1.50–$1.84 | $45–$55 | $180–$220 |
| 12,000–14,000 | 1,250–1,500W | $0.21–$0.26 | $1.70–$2.04 | $51–$61 | $204–$245 |

*Costs assume the compressor runs continuously. In practice, the compressor cycles on and off, reducing actual costs by 20%–40% depending on room conditions.*

## Cost by Electricity Rate

Electricity rates vary dramatically by state. Here's what a 10,000 DOE BTU portable AC (1,100W) costs at different rates, running 8 hours daily.

| State/Region | Rate ($/kWh) | Hourly | Monthly | Seasonal |
|-------------|-------------|--------|---------|----------|
| Louisiana | $0.10 | $0.11 | $26 | $106 |
| Texas (avg) | $0.13 | $0.14 | $34 | $137 |
| National average | $0.17 | $0.19 | $45 | $180 |
| Arizona | $0.14 | $0.15 | $37 | $148 |
| New York | $0.22 | $0.24 | $58 | $232 |
| Massachusetts | $0.28 | $0.31 | $74 | $296 |
| California | $0.30 | $0.33 | $79 | $317 |
| Connecticut | $0.32 | $0.35 | $85 | $338 |
| Hawaii | $0.40 | $0.44 | $106 | $422 |

<Callout type="warning">
**California and Northeast residents pay 2–3x the national average.** A portable AC that costs $45/month in Texas costs $79/month in California and $106/month in Hawaii. At these rates, investing in a more efficient unit (higher CEER) or a window AC/mini-split pays back much faster.

## Efficiency Matters: CEER Impact on Cost

CEER (Combined Energy Efficiency Ratio) directly determines how much electricity your unit uses per BTU of cooling. Higher CEER = lower bills.

| CEER Rating | Unit Type (Example) | Wattage for 10K BTU | Monthly Cost ($0.17/kWh, 8 hrs/day) | Annual Savings vs. CEER 8.0 |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 8.0 | Budget single-hose | 1,250W | $51 | Baseline |
| 9.0 | Mid-range single-hose | 1,111W | $45 | $72/year |
| 10.0 | Good single-hose or budget dual | 1,000W | $41 | $120/year |
| 11.0 | Premium dual-hose (Midea Duo) | 909W | $37 | $168/year |
| 12.0 | Best-in-class (rare for portables) | 833W | $34 | $204/year |

Moving from a CEER 8.0 budget unit to a CEER 11.0 premium unit saves $168/year. Over 5 years, that's $840 in savings against a typical $200–$300 price difference.

## Portable AC vs. Other Cooling Costs

| Cooling Method | Typical Wattage | Monthly Cost (8 hrs/day) | CEER/SEER2 |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Ceiling fan | 30–80W | $1–$3 | N/A |
| Box fan | 50–100W | $2–$4 | N/A |
| Evaporative cooler | 100–250W | $4–$10 | N/A |
| Portable AC (single-hose) | 900–1,400W | $37–$57 | 7.0–10.0 CEER |
| Portable AC (dual-hose) | 850–1,300W | $35–$53 | 8.5–11.2 CEER |
| Window AC | 500–1,200W | $20–$49 | 10.0–15.0 CEER |
| Mini-split (single-zone) | 300–900W | $12–$37 | 18–30 SEER2 |
| Central AC (3-ton) | 2,500–3,500W | $102–$143 | 14–22 SEER2 |

Portable ACs cost 2–3x more per BTU than window ACs and 3–5x more than mini-splits. But they cost far less than running central AC to cool one room — if you only need cooling in one or two rooms, a portable AC can actually reduce your overall electricity bill.

## Real-World Usage Patterns and Costs

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: Light User — Pacific Northwest**
Sarah in Portland, OR uses her 8,000 DOE BTU portable AC (900W) for about 20 days per year, averaging 6 hours per day. Portland Edison rate: $0.12/kWh. Annual cost: 900W × 6 hrs × 20 days × $0.12 / 1000 = **$12.96 per year**. At this usage level, efficiency barely matters — even a 50% less efficient unit would only add $6.50.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: Heavy User — Phoenix, AZ**
Mike in Phoenix runs his 12,000 DOE BTU portable AC (1,300W) for 10 hours per day, 180 days per year (May through October). APS rate: $0.13/kWh. Annual cost: 1,300W × 10 hrs × 180 days × $0.13 / 1000 = **$304.20 per year**. At this usage, upgrading from CEER 8.5 to CEER 11.0 would save roughly $90/year — the price difference pays for itself in 2 seasons.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: Budget Renter — New York City**
Alex in Brooklyn runs a 10,000 DOE BTU portable AC (1,100W) for 8 hours/day from June through September (120 days). Con Edison rate: $0.30/kWh. Annual cost: 1,100W × 8 hrs × 120 days × $0.30 / 1000 = **$316.80 per year**. At New York's high rates, the difference between a CEER 8.0 unit ($396/year) and a CEER 11.0 unit ($288/year) is $108/year. The higher-efficiency unit pays for its premium in one season.

## 8 Ways to Reduce Portable AC Electricity Costs

**1. Right-size your unit.** An oversized unit short-cycles (wastes energy), and an undersized unit runs nonstop. Match DOE BTU to your room size.

**2. Use a programmable timer.** Set the AC to turn off after you fall asleep and on 30 minutes before you wake. Cutting 2 hours of nightly runtime saves 25% of sleeping-hour costs.

**3. Close doors and seal gaps.** Every room you add to the cooling load doubles or triples energy consumption. Cool only the room you're in.

**4. Upgrade the window seal.** Replace the flimsy stock window kit with an aftermarket foam or plexiglass seal. Reducing hot air infiltration by 20%–40% directly translates to less compressor runtime.

**5. Clean the filter every 2 weeks.** A clogged filter restricts airflow, reducing efficiency by 10%–25%. Takes 5 minutes.

**6. Keep the exhaust hose short and straight.** Every extra foot and every bend increases backpressure, forcing the compressor to work harder.

**7. Use blackout curtains on sunny windows.** Solar heat through windows is a major load. Curtains can reduce solar heat gain by 40%–60%, significantly reducing how hard your AC works.

**8. Consider a dual-hose unit.** Dual-hose units save 10%–30% on electricity by eliminating negative pressure losses.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run a portable AC for 24 hours?",
    answer: "A 10,000 DOE BTU portable AC (1,100W) running continuously for 24 hours at $0.17/kWh costs about $4.49. In practice, the compressor cycles on and off, so actual 24-hour costs are typically $3.00–$3.80. At California's $0.30/kWh rate, 24-hour cost rises to $5.30–$6.70."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a portable AC use more electricity than a window AC?",
    answer: "Yes. For the same BTU output, a portable AC uses 30%–80% more electricity than a window AC. A 10,000 BTU window AC typically draws 700–900W while a portable AC of the same rating draws 1,000–1,200W. The extra electricity powers the additional work of venting heat through a hose and overcoming negative pressure losses."
  },
  {
    question: "How many watts does a portable AC use?",
    answer: "Depends on BTU size: 6,000 DOE BTU units use 600–750W, 8,000 DOE BTU use 750–950W, 10,000 DOE BTU use 950–1,200W, and 14,000 DOE BTU use 1,250–1,500W. Inverter models use 20%–40% less wattage on average because the compressor runs at variable speed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a portable AC run on a standard 15-amp circuit?",
    answer: "Yes — most portable ACs draw 6–13 amps, well within a standard 15-amp circuit's capacity. However, don't run a portable AC on the same circuit as other high-draw appliances (space heaters, microwaves, hair dryers). If the circuit breaker trips, the combined load exceeds 15 amps (1,800W)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it cheaper to run a portable AC or central air?",
    answer: "If you only need to cool one room, a portable AC is much cheaper. A 3-ton central AC drawing 3,000W costs $0.51/hour vs. $0.19/hour for a portable. But central AC cools your entire home while a portable AC cools one room. If you need whole-home cooling, central AC is more efficient per BTU across all rooms combined."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a portable AC add to my electric bill?",
    answer: "At $0.17/kWh running 8 hours/day for 30 days: a small unit (8K BTU) adds $30–$40, a mid-size unit (10K BTU) adds $40–$55, and a large unit (14K BTU) adds $55–$70. Multiply these figures proportionally for your local electricity rate."
  },
  {
    question: "Do portable ACs use electricity in standby mode?",
    answer: "Yes, but very little. Most portable ACs draw 1–5 watts in standby (plugged in but not running). That's about $0.01–$0.05 per day, or $2–$10 per year. CEER ratings account for standby power, which is why CEER is a better efficiency metric than EER."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can an inverter portable AC save?",
    answer: "Inverter compressors save 25%–40% compared to fixed-speed compressors at the same BTU rating. For a 10,000 DOE BTU unit running 8 hrs/day for 120 days at $0.17/kWh, that's $45–$75 per season in savings. The Midea Duo (inverter, CEER 11.2) saves approximately $70/year compared to a CEER 8.5 fixed-speed unit."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the cheapest way to cool one room?",
    answer: "From cheapest to most expensive per BTU: ceiling fan ($1–$3/month), evaporative cooler ($4–$10/month, dry climates only), window AC ($20–$50/month), portable AC ($35–$60/month). The cheapest actual air conditioning is a window AC. A portable AC is cheapest when no window installation is possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the portable AC cost the same to run in dehumidifier mode?",
    answer: "Dehumidifier mode typically costs slightly less because the unit doesn't need to cool air to as low a temperature — it just needs to reach the dew point. Expect 10%–20% less energy use in dehumidifier mode compared to cooling mode. Some units also run the fan at lower speed in dehumidifier mode, further reducing consumption."
