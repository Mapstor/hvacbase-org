# Best Portable AC & Heater Combos (2-in-1 Year-Round)

The best portable AC/heater combo in 2026 is the Whynter Elite ARC-1230WNH, delivering 12,000 DOE BTU cooling and 12,000 BTU heating through a dual-hose design with a CEER of 10.5. A 2-in-1 unit replaces both a portable AC and a space heater, saving $100–$200 in equipment costs and freeing up storage space — but you compromise slightly on both cooling and heating efficiency versus dedicated units.

These units make the most sense for studio apartments, single-room year-round climate control, renters who move frequently, and anyone short on closet space.

## How Combo Units Work

In cooling mode, these units work identically to any portable AC — the refrigeration cycle absorbs room heat and exhausts it outside through the hose.

In heating mode, most units use one of two methods. Electric resistance heating uses a heating element (like a space heater) inside the unit, drawing 1,000–1,500W to produce 3,400–5,100 BTU of heat. This is straightforward but inefficient. Heat pump mode reverses the refrigeration cycle, absorbing heat from outside air and pumping it indoors. Heat pump mode is 2–3x more efficient than resistance heating but only works effectively when outdoor temperatures are above 40°F–45°F.

| Heating Method | Efficiency | Effective Temp Range | Typical Output |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Electric resistance | 100% (1W = 3.412 BTU) | Any temperature | 3,400–5,100 BTU |
| Heat pump (COP 2.5) | 250% | Above 40°F outdoor | 8,500–12,000 BTU |

Most combo units in the $400–$600 range use electric resistance heating. Premium units ($550+) may offer heat pump mode, which is dramatically more efficient.

<Callout type="info">
**Heat pump mode is far more efficient.** A heat pump portable AC produces 2–3 BTU of heat per watt consumed vs. 3.4 BTU per watt for resistance heating. However, heat pump effectiveness drops as outdoor temperature falls below 45°F, and most portable heat pumps stop working below 40°F.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "Are portable AC heater combos worth it?",
    answer: "Yes, if you need both cooling and heating in the same room. The $50–$150 premium over a cooling-only unit is less than buying a separate space heater. The real value is convenience — one appliance handles both seasons."
  },
  {
    question: "How well do they heat a room?",
    answer: "Most produce 8,000–12,000 BTU of heat, sufficient for rooms up to 250–400 sq ft. Resistance heating works at any outdoor temperature. Heat pump models are more efficient but lose effectiveness below 40°F. For very cold climates (below 20°F), you may need supplemental heating."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need the exhaust hose for heating?",
    answer: "For resistance heating: no, disconnect the hose. For heat pump heating: yes, the hose must be connected to draw heat from outside air. Check your manual."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does heating cost per month?",
    answer: "A 10,000 BTU resistance heater at 1,200W costs about $49/month running 8 hours/day at $0.17/kWh. Heat pump mode at the same output costs $20–$30/month (2–3x more efficient)."
