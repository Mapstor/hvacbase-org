# Heat Pump Tax Credits & Rebates: 2026 Federal Guide

You can claim a **federal tax credit of up to $2,000** for a qualifying heat pump installed in 2026 under the Inflation Reduction Act's Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit. On top of that, federal HEEHRA rebates of up to $8,000 and state/utility incentives ranging from $500 to $16,000 can dramatically reduce — or even eliminate — your out-of-pocket cost.

The total potential savings from stacking federal, state, and utility incentives in 2026 ranges from $2,500 to $18,000+ depending on your state, income level, and system type. This guide explains every program available, the eligibility requirements, and exactly how to claim each one.

## Federal Tax Credit (Section 25C) 

The Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides a **30% credit on the total cost** (equipment + labor) of qualifying heat pump installations, capped at **$2,000 per year** for heat pumps specifically. This is part of a broader $3,200 annual cap for all energy efficiency improvements ($1,200 for other items + $2,000 for heat pumps/water heaters).

### Key Details for 2026

**Who qualifies:** Any U.S. taxpayer who installs a qualifying heat pump in their primary residence (the home where you live most of the year). Rental properties and second homes do NOT qualify.

**Annual, not lifetime:** Unlike the old credit, Section 25C resets every tax year. If you install a heat pump in 2026 and a heat pump water heater in 2027, you can claim $2,000 each year.

**Covers equipment and labor:** The 30% applies to the total installed cost, including the heat pump unit, air handler, thermostat, electrical work, and installation labor.

**No income limit:** Every taxpayer qualifies regardless of income. However, it's a nonrefundable credit — it can reduce your tax liability to zero but won't generate a refund. If you owe less than $2,000 in federal income tax, you can't claim the full credit in one year (but you can carry the unused amount forward in some cases — consult a tax professional).

<Callout type="example">
**Example Calculation:** You install a Carrier Infinity 24 heat pump for a total cost of $9,500 (equipment + labor). The 30% credit is $2,850 — but the cap is $2,000, so you claim $2,000 on your 2026 tax return. Your effective cost drops to $7,500.
</Callout>

## HEEHRA Rebates (Up to $8,000) 

The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act provides **point-of-sale rebates** — meaning the discount is applied at the time of purchase, so you don't have to wait until tax season. The amount depends on your household income relative to your area median income (AMI).

<ComparisonTable
  title="HEEHRA Rebate Amounts for Heat Pumps"
  headers={["Income Level", "Definition", "Heat Pump Rebate", "Electrical Panel Rebate", "Total Potential"]}
  rows={[
    ["Low income", "≤80% of Area Median Income", "Up to $8,000", "Up to $4,000", "$12,000+"],
    ["Moderate income", "80–150% of AMI", "Up to $4,000", "Up to $2,000", "$6,000+"],
    ["Above moderate", ">150% of AMI", "Not eligible", "Not eligible", "$0 (use 25C instead)"],
  ]}
/>

### HEEHRA Rollout Status in 2026

HEEHRA funding is distributed through state energy offices, and rollout timelines vary. As of early 2026, over 40 states have active HEEHRA programs. To check if your state's program is live, visit your state energy office website or search the DSIRE database.

<Callout type="important">
**HEEHRA + 25C Stacking:** In most cases, you CAN stack the HEEHRA rebate and the 25C tax credit. However, you can only claim the 25C credit on the portion of the cost NOT covered by the HEEHRA rebate. Example: $9,000 install − $4,000 HEEHRA = $5,000 remaining. 30% of $5,000 = $1,500 tax credit. Total incentive: $5,500.
</Callout>

## Geothermal Tax Credit (Section 25D) 

Geothermal (ground-source) heat pumps qualify for a separate, more generous credit under Section 25D — **30% of the total installed cost with NO cap**. For a $30,000 geothermal system, that's a $9,000 credit.

This credit has no income limit, no annual cap, and no maximum credit amount. Unlike 25C, Section 25D is a nonrefundable credit but can be carried forward to future tax years if your tax liability isn't large enough to use it all at once. The 30% rate is available through 2032, dropping to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034.

## State and Utility Rebates by Region 

State and utility rebates are in addition to federal credits and can be substantial. Here's a snapshot of what's available in early 2026 — always verify current amounts with your state energy office.

<ComparisonTable
  title="State and Utility Heat Pump Rebates (Selected States, 2026)"
  headers={["State / Program", "Rebate Amount", "Key Requirements", "Stacks with Federal?"]}
  rows={[
    ["Massachusetts (Mass Save)", "$10,000–$16,000", "Whole-home conversion, income-based", "Yes"],
    ["New York (NYSERDA)", "$1,000–$14,500", "Clean Heat Program, income-based", "Yes"],
    ["Maine (Efficiency Maine)", "$2,000–$4,000", "ENERGY STAR certified", "Yes"],
    ["Vermont (Efficiency Vermont)", "$2,000–$4,500", "Cold-climate ASHP", "Yes"],
    ["Colorado (Xcel Energy)", "$2,500–$5,000", "Cold climate rated", "Yes"],
    ["California (TECH Clean)", "$3,000–$5,500", "Replace gas furnace", "Yes"],
    ["Oregon (Energy Trust)", "$1,500–$3,000", "Ducted or ductless, ENERGY STAR", "Yes"],
    ["Washington (PSE/SCL)", "$1,500–$3,500", "ENERGY STAR, electric utility customer", "Yes"],

    ["New Jersey (NJ Clean Energy)", "$1,000–$4,000", "Whole-home electrification", "Yes"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**How to Find Your Local Rebates:** Search the DSIRE database (dsireusa.org) for your state and ZIP code. Also check your electric utility's website under "rebates" or "energy efficiency programs." Many utilities offer rebates that aren't listed in state databases.
</Callout>

## How to Stack Multiple Incentives 

The most powerful strategy is stacking federal, state, and utility incentives. Here are three real scenarios showing how stacking works.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Incentive Stacking Examples"
  headers={["", "Scenario A: Massachusetts", "Scenario B: Colorado", "Scenario C: Texas (no state)"]}
  rows={[
    ["System cost", "$12,000", "$9,500", "$7,500"],
    ["Federal 25C credit", "−$2,000", "−$2,000", "−$2,000"],
    ["HEEHRA (if eligible)", "−$4,000", "−$4,000", "$0"],
    ["State rebate", "−$10,000 (Mass Save)", "−$3,500 (Xcel)", "$0"],
    ["Utility rebate", "−$750", "−$500", "−$500"],
    ["Net cost to homeowner", "−$4,750 (paid back!)", "−$500 (paid back!)", "$5,000"],
  ]}
/>

In states with aggressive incentive programs, it's genuinely possible to get paid to install a heat pump. Even in states without additional incentives, the federal credit alone brings the cost down to a level competitive with conventional HVAC.

## Qualifying Equipment Requirements 

Not every heat pump qualifies for the full $2,000 credit. The unit must meet the **CEE Highest Efficiency Tier** in effect for the year of installation.

<ComparisonTable
  title="2026 Efficiency Requirements for Full Tax Credit"
  headers={["System Type", "Minimum SEER2", "Minimum HSPF2", "Minimum EER2", "Additional Requirements"]}
  rows={[
    ["Ducted air-source", "≥16.0", "≥9.0", "≥12.0", "ENERGY STAR certified"],
    ["Ductless mini split", "≥18.0", "≥9.5", "≥12.5", "ENERGY STAR certified"],
    ["Ground-source (25D)", "EER ≥17.1", "COP ≥3.6", "—", "ENERGY STAR certified, closed loop"],
    ["Ground-source (open loop)", "EER ≥21.1", "COP ≥4.1", "—", "ENERGY STAR certified"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
**Don't Assume Your Unit Qualifies:** The federal minimums changed for 2026 and may adjust again. Before purchasing, verify that your specific model number appears on the CEE qualifying product list or the ENERGY STAR product finder. Your HVAC contractor should confirm eligibility in writing before installation.
</Callout>

## How to Claim the Federal Tax Credit 

Claiming the 25C credit is straightforward but requires documentation.

**Step 1: Keep all receipts.** Save the contractor invoice, equipment specification sheet (showing model number and efficiency ratings), and proof of payment.

**Step 2: Obtain the Manufacturer Certification Statement.** Most manufacturers provide a certification statement (sometimes called a "tax credit certificate") confirming that the product meets the efficiency requirements. Check the manufacturer's website or ask your contractor.

**Step 3: File IRS Form 5695.** When you file your 2026 tax return (in early 2027), complete Part II of Form 5695 (Residential Energy Credits). Enter the total qualifying costs on line 24a, calculate 30%, and apply the $2,000 cap.

**Step 4: Enter the credit on Form 1040.** Transfer the credit from Form 5695 to your 1040 tax return. The credit reduces the tax you owe dollar-for-dollar.

## Common Mistakes That Cost You Money 

**Installing a unit that doesn't meet CEE requirements.** A heat pump with SEER2 15.5 (just below the 16.0 threshold) saves you nothing on the tax credit. Always confirm the exact model meets the CEE tier.

**Forgetting to claim the credit.** An estimated 30–40% of eligible homeowners fail to claim the 25C credit, leaving billions of dollars on the table nationally. If you installed a heat pump in 2024, 2026, or 2026 and didn't claim the credit, you can file an amended return.

**Not stacking with state/utility rebates.** Many homeowners claim the federal credit but never apply for their state or utility rebate. These rebates often require a separate application to the state energy office or utility company — they don't happen automatically.

**Installing in a rental or second home.** The 25C credit only applies to your primary residence. If you install a heat pump in a rental property or vacation home, it doesn't qualify (though it may be deductible as a business expense for rental properties).

**Waiting too long to apply for state rebates.** Many state and utility programs are funded on a first-come, first-served basis. Rebate pools can be exhausted before the program deadline. Apply within 30 days of installation.

## Key Takeaways

The **federal 25C tax credit covers 30% up to $2,000** for qualifying heat pumps in your primary residence — this is an annual credit, not a one-time benefit. **HEEHRA rebates of up to $8,000** are available for low-income households in 40+ states. **State and utility rebates of $500–$16,000** stack on top of federal credits. Geothermal systems qualify for a separate **30% credit with no cap** under Section 25D. Stacking all available incentives can reduce your heat pump cost by **$2,500–$18,000+**. Always verify your specific equipment meets CEE requirements before purchasing, and file the credit on IRS Form 5695.

<FAQ id="faq">
  <FAQ.Item question="How much is the heat pump tax credit in 2026?">
    The federal tax credit for heat pumps in 2026 is 30% of the total installed cost, up to a maximum of $2,000. This applies to qualifying air-source heat pumps installed in your primary residence. Geothermal heat pumps qualify for a separate 30% credit with no cap under Section 25D.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do all heat pumps qualify for the tax credit?">
    No. The heat pump must meet the CEE Highest Efficiency Tier requirements for the year of installation. For 2026, this generally means SEER2 ≥ 16.0 and HSPF2 ≥ 9.0 for ducted systems, or SEER2 ≥ 18.0 and HSPF2 ≥ 9.5 for ductless. Budget models that barely meet federal minimum efficiency standards do not qualify.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can I get the heat pump tax credit and HEEHRA rebate?">
    In most cases, yes. You can receive the HEEHRA point-of-sale rebate AND the 25C tax credit, but the 25C credit applies only to the portion of the cost not covered by the HEEHRA rebate. Example: $9,000 install minus $4,000 HEEHRA rebate = $5,000 remaining. 30% of $5,000 = $1,500 tax credit.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is the heat pump tax credit refundable?">
    No. The 25C credit is nonrefundable — it can reduce your tax liability to zero but won't generate a refund. If your federal tax liability for the year is less than $2,000, you can't claim the full credit. Some tax professionals advise adjusting withholding or timing income to maximize the credit. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can I claim the heat pump tax credit for a rental property?">
    No. The 25C credit applies only to your primary residence. However, heat pump installations in rental properties may be deductible as a business expense or eligible for depreciation. Consult a tax professional for rental property tax strategies.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How do I find my Area Median Income for HEEHRA?">
    The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) publishes AMI figures by county. Search "HUD income limits" and enter your county and household size. If your household income is ≤80% of AMI, you qualify for up to $8,000 in HEEHRA heat pump rebates. If 80–150% of AMI, you qualify for up to $4,000.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do mini splits qualify for the tax credit?">
    Yes, if they meet the CEE efficiency thresholds (SEER2 ≥ 18.0, HSPF2 ≥ 9.5 for ductless in 2026). Most premium and mid-range mini splits from Mitsubishi, Fujitsu, Daikin, and Carrier meet these requirements. Budget models may fall short — verify the specific model before purchasing.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can I claim the credit if I install the heat pump myself?">
    The IRS does not explicitly require professional installation for the 25C credit. However, DIY installation may void the manufacturer's warranty, disqualify you from state/utility rebates, and could complicate the tax credit claim if audited. Professional installation is strongly recommended for both tax credit eligibility and system reliability.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="When does the heat pump tax credit expire?">
    The Section 25C credit is available through December 31, 2032 at the current 30% rate. It was established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and runs for 10 years. The Section 25D geothermal credit runs at 30% through 2032, drops to 26% in 2033, and 22% in 2034.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What documentation do I need for the tax credit?">
    Keep these documents: the contractor's itemized invoice showing equipment model, capacity, and total cost; the manufacturer's certification statement confirming the product meets CEE requirements; proof of payment (receipt, credit card statement, or cancelled check); and the product specification sheet showing SEER2, HSPF2, and EER2 ratings. Attach none of these to your return — keep them in case of audit.
