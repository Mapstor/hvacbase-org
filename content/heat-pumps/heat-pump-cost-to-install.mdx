# Heat Pump Installation Cost: Complete Pricing Guide (2026)

The average heat pump installation costs $5,800–$10,000 in 2026 for a 3-ton ducted air-source system, including equipment and professional labor. After the $2,000 federal tax credit, your net cost drops to $3,800–$8,000. A single-zone mini split runs $2,700–$5,800 installed, while a ground-source (geothermal) system costs $18,000–$35,000 before incentives.

These numbers represent national averages from contractor pricing surveys in January 2026. Your actual cost depends on system type, capacity, brand, installation complexity, your region, and whether you need electrical upgrades or new ductwork.

**Geothermal qualifies for the 30% Section 25D tax credit (no cap), not the 25C credit.**

## Cost by System Type 

### Ducted Air-Source Heat Pump

This is the most common type, replacing your existing furnace and AC while using your home's ductwork. Equipment cost ranges from $2,200 to $7,000 depending on brand and efficiency tier. Installation labor runs $2,500–$5,000.

**Standard efficiency (SEER2 15–17, HSPF2 8–9):** These meet federal minimums and ENERGY STAR thresholds but don't qualify for the maximum tax credits. Total installed cost: $4,500–$8,000.

**High efficiency (SEER2 18–22, HSPF2 9.5–11+):** These qualify for the full $2,000 federal tax credit and most state rebates. Variable-speed compressors deliver better comfort and efficiency. Total installed cost: $7,500–$12,500.

**Cold-climate rated (SEER2 18+, HSPF2 10+, rated to −13 °F or below):** Premium units from Mitsubishi, Fujitsu, Daikin, and Bosch designed for zones 5–7. Total installed cost: $8,000–$13,000.

### Ductless Mini Split

Mini splits skip ductwork entirely, connecting an outdoor compressor to one or more wall-mounted indoor heads via refrigerant lines.

<ComparisonTable

  ]}
/>

### Ground-Source (Geothermal)

Geothermal systems exchange heat with the earth through buried pipes. The equipment itself costs $5,000–$8,000, but the ground loop installation (drilling or trenching) makes up the bulk of the cost.

**Horizontal loop (trenched):** Requires 400–600 feet of trench per ton. Works in large, flat yards. Total: $18,000–$28,000 for a 3-ton system.

**Vertical loop (bored wells):** Requires 150–200 feet of depth per ton. Works in smaller yards. Total: $22,000–$35,000 for a 3-ton system.

**Open loop (well water):** Uses groundwater directly. Cheapest to install but requires adequate water supply and a discharge strategy. Total: $15,000–$22,000 for a 3-ton system.

## Cost by Brand 

Brand premiums vary significantly. Here's what you'll typically pay for a 3-ton ducted system, installed.

<ComparisonTable
  title="2026 Heat Pump Cost by Brand (3-ton Ducted, Installed)"
  headers={["Brand", "Tier", "Total Installed Cost", "SEER2 Range", "Warranty (Compressor)"]}
  rows={[
    ["Carrier / Bryant", "Premium", "$8,000–$12,500", "16–22", "10 years"],
    ["Trane / American Standard", "Premium", "$7,500–$12,000", "15–22", "10 years (12 for XL)"],
    ["Lennox", "Premium", "$8,500–$13,000", "16–24", "10 years"],
    ["Mitsubishi (ducted)", "Premium", "$9,000–$13,500", "18–20", "12 years"],
    ["Daikin / Amana / Goodman", "Mid-Range", "$5,500–$9,500", "15–20", "10–12 years"],

    ["Rheem / Ruud", "Value", "$5,000–$8,500", "15–18", "10 years"],
    ["York / Johnson Controls", "Value", "$4,500–$8,000", "14–18", "10 years"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**Brand vs. Installer:** In HVAC, the quality of the installation matters more than the brand of the equipment. A mid-range Daikin installed by a skilled, detail-oriented contractor will outperform a premium Carrier installed by a rushed crew. Prioritize contractor reputation over brand name.

## Cost by System Size 

Heat pump cost scales with capacity. Larger homes need larger systems (more tons = more BTUs = higher cost).

<ComparisonTable
  title="Ducted Heat Pump Cost by Size (Mid-Range Brand, 2026)"
  headers={["Size", "BTU Capacity", "Typical Home", "Equipment", "Installation", "Total"]}
  rows={[

  ]}
/>

## Labor Cost Breakdown 

Installation labor typically represents 40–55% of the total project cost. Here's what you're paying for.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Installation Labor Components"
  headers={["Task", "Cost Range", "Time Required", "Notes"]}
  rows={[

    ["Ductwork modification", "$0–$2,000", "0–4 hours", "If existing ducts need adjustment"],
  ]}
/>

## What Increases Installation Cost 

Several factors can push your total well above the base price.

**Electrical panel upgrade:** Homes with 100A panels often need a 200A upgrade to accommodate the heat pump's 30–50A circuit. Cost: $1,500–$4,000.

**New ductwork:** If your home lacks ducts or the existing ductwork is severely deteriorated, new ducts cost $2,000–$5,000 for a single-story and $4,000–$8,000 for a multi-story home.

**Difficult access:** Second-story installations, tight crawl spaces, or attic air handler placements increase labor time and cost by $500–$1,500.

**Long refrigerant line runs:** Standard installations assume 15–25 feet of line set. Each additional 10 feet adds $150–$300.

**Code-required upgrades:** Some jurisdictions require a condensate pump, overflow switch, secondary drain pan, or seismic bracing that adds $100–$500.

**Crane or rigging:** Rooftop installations or tight-access properties may require a crane ($500–$1,500) to place the outdoor unit.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Suburban Chicago, IL:** The Park family's 2,400 sq ft colonial needed a 3.5-ton system. Their base quote was $9,200 (Bosch IDS 2.0, SEER2 18.5). Additions: electrical panel upgrade from 100A to 200A ($2,800), ductwork modifications to improve airflow ($1,200), and a Wi-Fi thermostat ($250). Final installed cost: $13,450. After $2,000 federal credit and $2,500 ComEd rebate: $8,950 net.

## Tax Credits and Rebates That Lower Your Cost 

The effective cost of a heat pump is significantly lower than the sticker price once you apply available incentives.

**Federal 25C Tax Credit:** 30% of total project cost, up to $2,000 per year. Applies to qualifying heat pumps (generally SEER2 ≥ 16, HSPF2 ≥ 9.0 for ducted; SEER2 ≥ 18, HSPF2 ≥ 9.5 for ductless). Covers equipment and labor.

**Federal 25D Tax Credit (Geothermal only):** 30% of total project cost with no cap. A $30,000 geothermal install receives a $9,000 credit.

**HEEHRA Rebates:** Up to $8,000 point-of-sale rebate, income-dependent. Available in 40+ states as of early 2026.

**State + Utility Rebates:** Range from $500 to $16,000 depending on your state and utility. See our complete [tax credits and rebates guide](/heat-pump-tax-credits-2026/).

<ComparisonTable
  title="Example After-Incentive Costs (3-ton Ducted, $9,000 Base)"

    ["Federal + moderate state", "$9,000", "−$2,000", "−$2,500", "$4,500"],
    ["Federal + strong state (MA)", "$9,000", "−$2,000", "−$10,000", "−$3,000*"],
    ["Federal + HEEHRA (low income)", "$9,000", "−$2,000", "−$8,000", "−$1,000*"],
  ]}
/>

*Negative net cost means the incentives exceed the project cost. Some programs cap the total rebate at the project cost; check your specific program rules.*

## How to Get the Best Price 

**Get at least 3 quotes.** Pricing varies widely between contractors. We've seen quotes for identical systems range from $6,500 to $12,000 in the same market. Three quotes give you a clear picture of the fair market rate.

**Ask what's included.** A low quote that excludes the thermostat, disconnect, line set cover, and permits isn't actually cheap. Request itemized quotes that break out equipment, labor, materials, permits, and warranty terms.

**Time your installation wisely.** Spring (March–May) and fall (September–November) are the sweet spots. Contractors are less busy than during peak summer/winter demand, and many offer shoulder-season discounts of 5–15%.

**Consider mid-range brands.** Daikin, Bosch, and Rheem offer excellent performance at 20–30% lower cost than Carrier, Trane, and Lennox. The efficiency gap is often marginal (1–2 SEER2 points).

**Stack every incentive.** Federal tax credit + state rebate + utility rebate + manufacturer rebate can sometimes be combined. Your HVAC contractor should know which programs you qualify for.

**Finance strategically.** Many utilities and state programs offer 0% or low-interest financing for heat pump installations. Some contractor financing programs charge 12–18% interest — compare all options before signing.

<FAQ id="faq">
  <FAQ.Item question="How much does a heat pump cost to install in 2026?">
    A ducted air-source heat pump costs $5,800–$10,000 installed for a 3-ton system. A single-zone mini split costs $2,700–$5,800. A geothermal system costs $18,000–$35,000. After federal tax credits ($2,000 for air-source, 30% uncapped for geothermal) and state rebates, net costs are significantly lower. The national average for a mid-range ducted system is about $7,500 before incentives.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is it cheaper to install a heat pump or a furnace and AC?">
    A gas furnace + AC combo costs $4,500–$6,500 installed, versus $5,800–$10,000 for a heat pump. However, after the $2,000 federal tax credit and state rebates, the heat pump often costs the same or less out of pocket. The heat pump also saves $500–$1,200/year on operating costs, making it the cheaper long-term choice in most cases.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How long does heat pump installation take?">
    A standard ducted heat pump replacement takes 1–2 days. A single-zone mini split takes 4–8 hours. A multi-zone mini split system takes 2–3 days. A geothermal system takes 1–2 weeks (mostly for the ground loop). If an electrical panel upgrade is needed, add 1 day. Permit acquisition may add 1–4 weeks before work begins.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do I need new ductwork for a heat pump?">
    Not necessarily. If your existing ductwork is in good condition and properly sized, it works fine with a heat pump. However, heat pumps move more air at lower temperatures than furnaces, so ductwork that's undersized or leaky can cause comfort issues. A contractor should inspect your ducts and recommend sealing (which costs $500–$1,500) or replacement ($2,000–$8,000) if needed.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What is included in a heat pump installation quote?">
    A thorough quote should include the outdoor unit, indoor air handler or coil, refrigerant line set, thermostat, electrical disconnect, condensate drain, mounting pad or brackets, all labor, system commissioning and testing, permit fees, and warranty terms. Ask specifically if the quote includes removal of old equipment, new thermostat wiring, and any needed ductwork modifications.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can I finance a heat pump installation?">
    Yes. Common financing options include utility-sponsored 0% financing (available from many electric utilities), PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) loans repaid through property taxes, manufacturer financing through dealers (often 0% for 12–24 months), home equity loans or lines of credit, and personal loans. Compare interest rates carefully — some dealer financing programs charge 12–18% after the promotional period.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does it cost to add a heat pump to an existing furnace?">
    Adding a heat pump to work alongside your existing gas furnace (a "dual-fuel" or hybrid system) costs $3,500–$7,000 for the heat pump equipment and installation. You keep your furnace as backup for the coldest days, and the heat pump handles heating in moderate weather plus all cooling. This is a popular option in cold climates since it avoids the cost of replacing a working furnace.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Why are heat pump quotes so different from each other?">
    Common reasons include different equipment brands and efficiency tiers, varying warranty terms (5-year vs. 10-year labor warranty), scope differences (some quotes include ductwork and electrical work, others don't), contractor overhead and profit margins, and whether the contractor is factory-authorized. Always compare quotes on an apples-to-apples basis by specifying the same efficiency tier and included work.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is a geothermal heat pump worth the extra cost?">
    A geothermal system costs 2–3× more upfront than an air-source heat pump ($18,000–$35,000 vs. $5,800–$10,000). However, it operates at 40–60% higher efficiency and qualifies for a 30% tax credit with no cap ($5,400–$10,500 credit). The ground loop lasts 50+ years. Geothermal makes the most financial sense for new construction (lower loop installation cost), homes with high heating loads (zones 5–7), and homeowners planning to stay 15+ years.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What is the cheapest heat pump to install?">
    The cheapest option is a DIY mini split like the MrCool DIY 4th Gen at $1,400–$2,200 total (no professional installation needed). The cheapest professionally installed option is a single-zone mini split from a value brand like Senville or Cooper & Hunter at $2,500–$3,500 total. For whole-home ducted systems, value brands like Goodman or York start at $4,500–$6,000 installed.
