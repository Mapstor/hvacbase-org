# Heat Pumps: Complete Homeowner's Guide (2026)

A heat pump is an electric HVAC system that moves heat instead of generating it, delivering 2–5× more energy than it consumes — making it the most efficient way to heat and cool a home in 2026. The average U.S. homeowner who switches from a gas furnace to a modern heat pump saves $500–$1,200 per year on energy bills while cutting household carbon emissions by 40–65%.

In 2026, heat pumps outsell gas furnaces in the United States for the fourth consecutive year. With federal tax credits covering up to $2,000, cold-climate models now rated to −15 °F, and SEER2 ratings exceeding 22, the technology has matured well beyond its warm-climate roots. This guide covers every detail you need to make a confident decision.

## How a Heat Pump Works

A heat pump doesn't create heat — it moves it. Think of it as a refrigerator running in reverse. In winter, it extracts heat energy from outdoor air (yes, even cold air contains heat energy) and pumps it inside. In summer, it reverses the cycle and pulls heat out of your home, working exactly like an air conditioner.

The core components are straightforward: a compressor, two heat exchangers (one indoor, one outdoor), an expansion valve, and refrigerant. The compressor is the heart of the system — it pressurizes the refrigerant, raising its temperature so the heat can be released indoors. Modern variable-speed (inverter) compressors adjust their output in real time, running at exactly the capacity your home needs rather than cycling on and off.

This "move heat instead of make heat" approach is why heat pumps are so efficient. A gas furnace converts fuel to heat at 80–98% efficiency — meaning one unit of energy in produces at most 0.98 units of heat. A heat pump, by contrast, can produce 3–4 units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed, giving it an effective efficiency of 300–400%.

<Callout type="info">
**The Physics in Plain English:** Air at 0 °F still contains about 85% of the heat energy present in air at 70 °F. A heat pump's refrigerant boils at temperatures far below zero, allowing it to absorb heat from air that feels freezing cold to you.
</Callout>

### The Refrigeration Cycle Step by Step

The heating cycle works in four stages. First, the **evaporator coil** in the outdoor unit allows liquid refrigerant to absorb heat from outdoor air and evaporate into a gas. Second, the **compressor** squeezes that gas, dramatically raising its temperature from near-outdoor temps to 100–140 °F. Third, the **condenser coil** in the indoor unit releases the hot refrigerant's heat into your home's air as it condenses back to liquid. Finally, the **expansion valve** drops the liquid refrigerant's pressure and temperature, and the cycle repeats.

In cooling mode, the reversing valve swaps the roles of the indoor and outdoor coils. Your heat pump becomes a standard air conditioner.

## Types of Heat Pumps

There are three main categories, each with distinct use cases, costs, and performance profiles.

/>

### Air-Source Heat Pumps (Ducted)

The most common type in North America. These replace or supplement your existing furnace and use your home's ductwork. Modern ducted air-source units from Carrier, Trane, Lennox, and others achieve SEER2 ratings of 16–22 and HSPF2 ratings of 8–11.

**Best for:** Homes with existing ductwork that want a single whole-house system. A 3-ton ducted system typically costs $5,000–$9,000 installed.

### Ductless Mini Splits

Mini splits connect a compact outdoor unit to one or more wall-mounted indoor heads via refrigerant lines. Each indoor head has its own thermostat, giving you room-by-room temperature control — often called "zoning." Top-tier models like the Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat and Fujitsu XLTH achieve COPs above 3.0 even at −13 °F.

**Best for:** Homes without ductwork, additions, garages, or homeowners who want zone-by-zone control. A single-zone system starts around $3,000 installed; a four-zone system runs $8,000–$15,000.

### Ground-Source (Geothermal) Heat Pumps

These exchange heat with the earth instead of the air, using loops of pipe buried in your yard or drilled vertically into wells. Because underground temperatures stay 45–65 °F year-round (depending on latitude), geothermal systems maintain high efficiency even in the coldest weather.

**Best for:** Homeowners prioritizing maximum efficiency and long-term savings, especially in new construction where loop installation is simpler. The 20–25 year equipment lifespan and 50+ year loop lifespan can make up for the $18,000–$35,000 upfront cost.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Minneapolis, MN:** The Andersons replaced their 80% AFUE gas furnace with a 3-ton Bosch IDS 2.0 ducted heat pump (SEER2 18.5, HSPF2 10). Their annual heating + cooling costs dropped from $2,400 to $1,350 — a $1,050 savings. With the $2,000 federal tax credit, the system's payback period was under 5 years.
</Callout>

## Key Efficiency Ratings Explained

Heat pump efficiency ratings can be confusing because there are multiple metrics. Here's what each one means and the minimum values you should target in 2026.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Heat Pump Efficiency Ratings"
  headers={["Rating", "Measures", "2026 Federal Minimum", "Good", "Excellent"]}
  rows={[
    ["SEER2", "Seasonal cooling efficiency", "14.3 (South) / 13.4 (North)", "16–18", "20+"],
    ["EER2", "Cooling efficiency at peak load (95 °F)", "No federal minimum", "10–12", "13+"],
    ["HSPF2", "Seasonal heating efficiency", "7.5", "9–10", "11+"],
    ["COP", "Instantaneous heating efficiency (ratio)", "—", "3.0–3.5", "4.0+"],
    ["ENERGY STAR", "Exceeds federal minimums", "—", "SEER2 ≥ 15.2 / HSPF2 ≥ 8.1", "CEE Tier 1+"],
  ]}
/>

**SEER2** (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio 2) is the cooling-season efficiency. It's calculated under the updated M1 testing standard introduced in 2023, which uses higher static pressure to better reflect real-world ductwork. A SEER2 of 20 means the unit produces 20 BTU of cooling for every watt-hour of electricity.

**HSPF2** (Heating Seasonal Performance Factor 2) is the heating-season equivalent. An HSPF2 of 10 means the unit delivers 10 BTU of heat per watt-hour across the heating season. Divide HSPF2 by 3.412 to get the approximate seasonal COP (so HSPF2 10 ≈ COP 2.93).

**COP** (Coefficient of Performance) is the real-time ratio of heat delivered to electricity consumed, measured at a specific outdoor temperature. A COP of 3.5 means 3.5 kWh of heat per 1 kWh of electricity. COP drops as outdoor temps fall, which is why the rated COP at 47 °F is always higher than the rated COP at 17 °F or 5 °F. For a deeper explanation, see our [COP Explained guide](/heat-pump-cop-explained/).

<Callout type="tip">
**Quick Rule of Thumb:** Multiply the COP by your electricity rate to get your cost per BTU of heat. If electricity is $0.14/kWh and COP is 3.0, your effective cost is $0.047/kWh of heat — cheaper than natural gas at $1.20/therm in most markets.

## Heat Pump Cost Breakdown

Total cost depends on system type, capacity, brand, and installation complexity. Below are 2026 national averages based on contractor survey data.

<ComparisonTable
  title="2026 Heat Pump Installed Cost Ranges"
  headers={["System Type / Size", "Equipment Cost", "Installation Labor", "Total Installed Cost"]}
  rows={[
    ["Ducted Air-Source (2 ton)", "$2,200–$4,500", "$2,500–$4,000", "$4,700–$8,500"],
    ["Ducted Air-Source (3 ton)", "$2,800–$5,500", "$3,000–$4,500", "$5,800–$10,000"],
    ["Ducted Air-Source (5 ton)", "$3,500–$7,000", "$3,500–$5,500", "$7,000–$12,500"],

  ]}
/>

### What Drives Installation Cost Up

Several factors can push your quote above the averages. Electrical panel upgrades (from 100A to 200A) add $1,500–$4,000. If your home needs new ductwork, expect $2,000–$5,000 for a single-story and up to $8,000 for a two-story. Refrigerant line sets running through finished walls or ceilings cost more than exposed runs. Permit fees range from $100–$500 depending on your municipality.

For a detailed breakdown by region and system type, see our [Heat Pump Installation Cost Guide](/heat-pump-cost-to-install/).

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Denver, CO:** Sarah's 1,800 sq ft ranch home needed a 3-ton ducted system. Her quotes ranged from $7,200 to $11,500. The lowest-price contractor proposed a standard-efficiency unit (SEER2 15.2) with basic installation. The highest quote included a Carrier Infinity 24 (SEER2 20.5), a Wi-Fi thermostat, a new disconnect box, and a 10-year labor warranty. She chose the mid-range quote at $8,900 for a Trane XR16 with good efficiency and solid warranty coverage.

## Operating Costs vs Other Systems

The real cost comparison isn't just equipment — it's what you pay each month to stay comfortable. Heat pumps almost always win on operating cost, but the margin depends on your local electricity and gas prices.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Annual Heating Cost Comparison (2,000 sq ft home, Climate Zone 4)"
  headers={["System", "Efficiency", "Annual Heating Cost*", "Annual Cooling Cost*", "Total Annual"]}

*Assumes $0.14/kWh electricity, $1.30/therm gas, $3.50/gal oil, $2.50/gal propane. Your local rates will vary — use our [running cost calculator](/heat-pump-running-cost-calculator/) for a personalized estimate.*

The takeaway: heat pumps are competitive with even high-efficiency gas systems and dramatically cheaper than oil, propane, or electric resistance heating. See our [electricity usage guide](/heat-pump-electricity-usage/) for a deeper dive into monthly kWh consumption.

## How to Size a Heat Pump

Proper sizing is the single most important factor in heat pump performance. An oversized unit short-cycles (turning on and off rapidly), wasting energy and failing to dehumidify. An undersized unit can't keep up on the coldest days.

### Manual J Load Calculation

The industry standard is ACCA Manual J, which calculates your home's actual heating and cooling loads based on insulation levels, window area and type, orientation, climate zone, infiltration rate, and internal heat gains. A proper Manual J should produce two numbers: your heating design load (BTU/h) and your cooling design load (BTU/h).

<Callout type="warning">
**Avoid Rule-of-Thumb Sizing:** Some contractors still use shortcuts like "500 sq ft per ton" or "one ton per 600 sq ft." These ignore your home's actual characteristics and frequently lead to oversized systems. Always insist on a Manual J calculation — the better contractors do it automatically.
</Callout>

### Rough Sizing Reference

While not a substitute for Manual J, these ranges give you a ballpark to sanity-check contractor quotes.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Approximate Heat Pump Sizing by Home Size (Climate Zone 4)"
  headers={["Home Size (sq ft)", "Typical Cooling Load", "Typical Heating Load", "Common System Size"]}
  rows={[
    ["800–1,200", "18,000–24,000 BTU", "20,000–30,000 BTU", "1.5–2 ton"],
    ["1,200–1,800", "24,000–36,000 BTU", "30,000–45,000 BTU", "2–3 ton"],
    ["1,800–2,500", "36,000–48,000 BTU", "45,000–60,000 BTU", "3–4 ton"],
    ["2,500–3,500", "48,000–60,000 BTU", "60,000–80,000 BTU", "4–5 ton"],
    ["3,500+", "60,000+ BTU", "80,000+ BTU", "5+ ton or multiple units"],
  ]}
/>

In cold climates (zones 5–7), heating loads are often 30–50% higher than cooling loads, so the system is typically sized to meet the heating load with an appropriately matched indoor coil for cooling.

## Installation Process

A typical ducted heat pump installation takes 1–2 days. Here's what to expect.

**Day 1 — Equipment swap.** The crew disconnects and removes your old outdoor unit (and possibly the old furnace or air handler). They set the new outdoor unit on a concrete pad or mounting brackets, install the new indoor air handler, and connect the refrigerant lines, condensate drain, and control wiring. For a straightforward replacement, most of this happens in a single day.

**Day 2 (if needed) — Electrical and finishing.** If your electrical panel needs an upgrade or a new circuit is required (heat pumps typically need a 30–50 amp 240V circuit), an electrician handles that work. The crew tests the system, checks refrigerant charge, programs the thermostat, and walks you through operation.

For mini splits, installation is usually faster — a single-zone system takes 4–8 hours. The installer mounts the indoor head, places the outdoor unit, drills a 3-inch hole through the wall for the line set, connects everything, and commissions the system.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Charlotte, NC:** The Nguyens had a 15-year-old gas furnace with a separate AC. They chose a Lennox XP25 ducted heat pump (SEER2 19.5, HSPF2 10.2). The installation took 1.5 days. Their existing ductwork was reused after sealing visible leaks. Total project cost was $9,400 before the $2,000 tax credit brought it to $7,400 effective.
</Callout>

## Heat Pumps in Cold Climates

The biggest misconception about heat pumps is that they don't work in cold weather. That was partially true of older models, but 2026 cold-climate heat pumps have fundamentally changed the equation.

### How Cold Is Too Cold?

Modern cold-climate heat pumps from Mitsubishi, Fujitsu, Daikin, Bosch, and Carrier are rated to maintain full heating capacity down to 5 °F and continue operating (at reduced capacity) down to −13 °F to −22 °F. The Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat H2i, for instance, maintains 100% rated capacity at 5 °F and still produces 75% of rated capacity at −13 °F.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Cold Climate Heat Pump Performance"
  headers={["Model", "Rated Capacity at 47 °F", "% Capacity at 5 °F", "Minimum Operating Temp", "COP at 5 °F"]}
  rows={[
    ["Mitsubishi Hyper-Heat MSZ-RW", "24,000 BTU", "100%", "−13 °F", "2.2"],
    ["Fujitsu XLTH", "24,000 BTU", "95%", "−15 °F", "2.0"],
    ["Daikin Fit (Aurora)", "36,000 BTU", "76%", "−13 °F", "1.8"],
    ["Bosch IDS 2.0", "36,000 BTU", "80%", "−4 °F", "1.9"],
    ["Carrier Infinity 24 (Greenspeed)", "36,000 BTU", "72%", "0 °F", "1.8"],
  ]}
/>

Even at −15 °F with a COP of 1.5–2.0, a heat pump is 50–100% more efficient than electric resistance heat. For a complete deep dive, see our guide to [heat pumps in cold weather](/heat-pump-in-cold-weather/) and the roundup of [best cold climate heat pumps](/best-cold-climate-heat-pumps/).

### Backup Heat Strategies

Most cold-climate installations use one of three backup strategies.

**Dual-fuel (hybrid):** The heat pump handles heating down to a balance point (often 25–35 °F), then a gas or propane furnace takes over. This approach minimizes electricity use during the coldest hours while still capturing heat pump efficiency for 70–80% of the heating season.

**Electric resistance backup:** Strip heaters in the air handler kick in when the heat pump can't keep up. Simple and cheap to install, but expensive to run — use only if the heat pump covers 90%+ of heating hours.

**Cold-climate heat pump sized to load:** The newest approach — size a cold-climate heat pump to meet 100% of the heating load even at design temperature. No backup needed. This works best with inverter-driven systems that modulate capacity smoothly.

## 2026 Tax Credits and Rebates

The financial incentives for heat pumps in 2026 remain substantial, making this one of the best years to invest.

### Federal Tax Credit (25C)

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, you can claim a **30% tax credit up to $2,000** for a qualifying heat pump installed in your primary residence. The heat pump must meet the CEE highest efficiency tier requirements, which for 2026 generally means SEER2 ≥ 16 and HSPF2 ≥ 9.0 for ducted systems, or SEER2 ≥ 18 and HSPF2 ≥ 9.5 for ductless.

This is an annual credit — you can claim it every year you make qualifying improvements, not just once. It applies to both equipment and installation labor costs.

### HOMES and HEAR Rebates

The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act (HEEHRA) provides **point-of-sale rebates up to $8,000** for heat pumps, with higher amounts for low- and moderate-income households. Eligibility and rollout vary by state — as of early 2026, over 40 states have active programs. Check the DSIRE database or your state energy office for current availability.

### State and Utility Incentives

Many states and utilities offer additional rebates on top of the federal credit.

<ComparisonTable

</Callout>

## Maintenance Requirements

Heat pumps require minimal maintenance, but consistent upkeep protects your efficiency and extends the system's lifespan.

### What You Can Do (Monthly/Quarterly)

**Check and replace air filters** every 1–3 months. A clogged filter restricts airflow, forcing the compressor to work harder and cutting efficiency by 5–15%. **Keep the outdoor unit clear** — remove leaves, snow, and debris, maintaining 18–24 inches of clearance on all sides. **Inspect the condensate drain** periodically since a blocked drain causes water damage and can trigger a system shutdown.

### What a Technician Should Do (Annually)

An annual professional tune-up costs $80–$200 and typically includes checking refrigerant charge and pressures, cleaning indoor and outdoor coils, testing the defrost cycle, inspecting and tightening electrical connections, lubricating motors and bearings (if applicable), and verifying thermostat calibration.

### Lifespan Expectations

A well-maintained air-source heat pump lasts 15–20 years. Mini splits have a similar lifespan, sometimes longer since they avoid ductwork losses. Ground-source units last 20–25 years for the equipment and 50+ years for the ground loop.

## Common Myths Debunked

**Myth: Heat pumps don't work below freezing.** Modern cold-climate units maintain full capacity to 5 °F and operate down to −13 °F or colder. Millions of homes in Scandinavia (where temps hit −20 °F regularly) rely on heat pumps as their primary heat source.

**Myth: Heat pumps are only for mild climates.** Norway, where winter temps regularly drop below 0 °F, has the highest per-capita heat pump adoption in the world. Over 60% of Norwegian homes use heat pumps.

**Myth: Heat pump air feels cold and drafty.** Older single-speed units delivered air at 90–95 °F (versus a furnace's 120–140 °F), which felt lukewarm. Modern inverter units deliver 100–110 °F air continuously, which feels comfortable and maintains even temperatures.

**Myth: Heat pumps are too expensive.** After federal and state incentives, many homeowners pay less for a heat pump than for a comparable gas furnace + AC system. The operating cost savings start immediately.

**Myth: Heat pumps are noisy.** Modern outdoor units run at 55–65 dB (the level of a normal conversation). Mini split indoor heads run at 19–26 dB — quieter than a whisper.

<Callout type="takeaway" id="key-takeaways">
## Key Takeaways

**Heat pumps deliver 2–5× more energy than they consume**, making them the most efficient heating and cooling technology available. Modern cold-climate models work reliably to −15 °F, eliminating the "it's too cold" barrier for most of the U.S. Total installed cost ranges from $3,000 for a single-zone mini split to $35,000 for geothermal, with ducted air-source averaging $5,800–$10,000. Federal tax credits of up to $2,000 plus state rebates of $1,000–$16,000 can slash your out-of-pocket cost dramatically. Annual operating savings of $500–$1,200 versus gas furnaces deliver payback periods of 3–8 years. Proper sizing via Manual J is critical — insist on a load calculation, not rule-of-thumb guesses. Maintenance is minimal: monthly filter changes plus one annual professional tune-up.

<FAQ id="faq">
  <FAQ.Item question="How long does a heat pump last?">
    A ducted air-source heat pump typically lasts 15–20 years with proper maintenance. Mini splits have a similar lifespan. Ground-source (geothermal) heat pump equipment lasts 20–25 years, while the ground loop can last 50+ years. Factors that shorten lifespan include oversizing (causes short-cycling), lack of maintenance, coastal salt air exposure, and extreme cycling in very cold climates without proper cold-climate ratings.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can a heat pump replace my furnace and air conditioner?">
    Yes. A heat pump provides both heating and cooling in a single system, replacing both your furnace and air conditioner. In moderate climates (zones 1–4), a single heat pump can handle 100% of your heating and cooling needs. In cold climates (zones 5–7), you may want a dual-fuel (hybrid) setup that pairs the heat pump with a gas furnace for the coldest days, though modern cold-climate heat pumps can often handle the full load alone.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Are heat pumps worth it in 2026?">
    For most homeowners, yes. With 2026 federal tax credits up to $2,000, state rebates often adding $1,000–$16,000, and energy savings of $500–$1,200 per year, the payback period is typically 3–8 years. After that, you save money every year for the remaining 10–15 years of the system's life. The value is even stronger if you're replacing an aging AC or furnace that needs replacement anyway.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does a heat pump cost per month to run?">
    The average U.S. home with a heat pump spends $80–$160 per month on heating and cooling combined, depending on climate, home size, insulation quality, and local electricity rates. This compares to $120–$200 per month for gas furnace + AC and $200–$350 per month for oil or propane heating + AC.

    Size depends on your home's specific heating and cooling loads, determined by a Manual J calculation. As a rough reference: a 1,500 sq ft well-insulated home in a moderate climate needs about 2–2.5 tons (24,000–30,000 BTU/h), while a 2,500 sq ft home might need 3.5–4 tons. Insulation level, window quality, climate zone, and home layout all matter — always get a professional load calculation.

  <FAQ.Item question="Do heat pumps work with radiators?">
    Standard air-source heat pumps work with forced-air ductwork or ductless wall heads, not radiators. However, air-to-water heat pumps (from SpacePak, Chiltrix, and Arctic Heat Pumps) produce hot water that can feed radiators, radiant floor systems, and baseboard heaters. These units work best with low-temperature distribution systems (radiant floors, fan coil units) since they produce water at 100–130 °F versus a boiler's 160–180 °F.

  <FAQ.Item question="How loud is a heat pump?">
    Modern outdoor units produce 55–65 dB at normal operation — equivalent to a quiet conversation or light rainfall. Mini split indoor heads are remarkably quiet at 19–32 dB on low fan speed, softer than a whisper. Older or oversized units can be louder (up to 75 dB), which is one reason proper sizing matters. Noise levels increase during defrost cycles but these typically last only 5–15 minutes.

  <FAQ.Item question="Can I install a heat pump myself?">
    DIY installation is not recommended for most homeowners. Heat pump installation involves handling refrigerant (which requires EPA Section 608 certification), high-voltage electrical work, and precise system commissioning. Improper installation causes the majority of heat pump performance problems. Some pre-charged mini split systems (like MrCool DIY) are designed for homeowner installation, but even these require careful attention to electrical work and line set connections. DIY installation may void the manufacturer's warranty and disqualify you from utility rebates.

  <FAQ.Item question="What is the best heat pump brand?">
    The "best" brand depends on your priorities. For cold-climate ductless performance, Mitsubishi and Fujitsu lead with the best low-temperature ratings. For ducted whole-home systems, Carrier, Trane, and Lennox offer excellent products with strong dealer networks. Daikin (which also owns Amana and Goodman) provides strong mid-range value. Bosch is popular for quiet operation and competitive pricing. What matters most is proper sizing, quality installation, and a reputable local contractor — brand differences are secondary.

  <FAQ.Item question="Will a heat pump increase my home's value?">
    Yes. Studies from Zillow and Redfin show that homes with heat pumps sell for 4–7% more than comparable homes with conventional HVAC, with the premium highest in moderate and warm climates. An ENERGY STAR-rated heat pump is also an asset on home energy audits and appraisals. As building electrification codes tighten and buyer awareness grows, the resale value benefit is expected to increase through the late 2020s.
