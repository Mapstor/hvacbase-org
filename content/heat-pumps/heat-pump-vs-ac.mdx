# Heat Pump vs Air Conditioner: What's the Difference?

The core difference is that a heat pump can both heat and cool your home, while an air conditioner only cools. In cooling mode, they're functionally identical — same compressor, same refrigerant cycle, same SEER2 efficiency ratings. The heat pump simply adds a reversing valve that lets it run the refrigerant cycle in reverse to provide heating, eliminating the need for a separate furnace.

In 2026, a ducted heat pump costs $5,800–$10,000 installed versus $3,500–$6,000 for a central AC (which still requires a separate $2,000–$4,500 furnace for heating). When you factor in the heat pump's lower operating costs and available tax credits, the heat pump is the better investment for most homeowners.

## How They Work (The Technical Difference) 

An air conditioner and a heat pump use the exact same refrigerant cycle for cooling. Both have a compressor, condenser coil, expansion valve, and evaporator coil. The compressor pumps refrigerant in a loop: the refrigerant absorbs heat from indoor air at the evaporator coil, then releases that heat outdoors at the condenser coil.

The heat pump adds one critical component: a **reversing valve**. This valve lets the system switch the direction of refrigerant flow, swapping the roles of the indoor and outdoor coils. In heating mode, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator (absorbing heat from outside air) and the indoor coil becomes the condenser (releasing heat into your home).

That's it. The reversing valve and its associated controls are the only hardware difference. A heat pump outdoor unit looks identical to an AC condenser, weighs about the same, and connects to the same type of indoor air handler or coil.

<Callout type="info">
**Why the Price Difference Is Small:** Since a heat pump is essentially an AC with a reversing valve added, the equipment cost premium is only $500–$1,500. The difference in installed cost comes from additional components like the defrost control board, a supplemental heat strip for backup, and slightly more complex controls.
</Callout>

## Cooling Performance: Are They Equal? 

In cooling mode, a heat pump and an air conditioner of the same SEER2 rating perform identically. A SEER2 18 heat pump and a SEER2 18 AC will deliver the same amount of cooling per watt of electricity, produce the same dehumidification, and use the same amount of energy to cool your home.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Cooling Performance Comparison (3-ton, SEER2 18)"
  headers={["Metric", "Heat Pump", "Central AC", "Difference"]}
  rows={[
    ["Cooling capacity at 95 °F", "36,000 BTU/h", "36,000 BTU/h", "None"],
    ["kWh per cooling season (zone 4)", "1,700 kWh", "1,700 kWh", "None"],

    ["Annual cooling cost @ $0.14/kWh", "$238", "$238", "None"],
  ]}
/>

The only cooling-related difference: in extremely hot climates (Phoenix, Las Vegas), some contractors prefer AC-only systems because the reversing valve in a heat pump introduces one additional potential failure point. However, modern reversing valves are highly reliable, and this concern is largely outdated.

## Cost Comparison: Equipment + Operating 

The real cost comparison must account for the total HVAC system. An AC needs a furnace for heating; a heat pump handles both.

<ComparisonTable

  headers={["Cost Category", "Heat Pump System", "AC + Gas Furnace System"]}
  rows={[

  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**The 10-Year Math:** Even in the worst case (high electricity, cheap gas), the heat pump saves $3,800 over 10 years. In the best case (moderate electricity rates, higher gas prices, plus state rebates), the savings exceed $10,000 over the heat pump's lifetime.
</Callout>

## Efficiency Comparison 

### Cooling Efficiency

In cooling mode, both systems use the same SEER2 scale. The federal minimum in 2026 is SEER2 13.4 (northern region) or 14.3 (southern region). Premium models from both categories reach SEER2 20–22. There is no inherent efficiency advantage to either system in cooling mode.

### Heating Efficiency

Here's where the heat pump dominates. A gas furnace converts fuel to heat at 80–98% efficiency (0.80–0.98 COP equivalent). A heat pump delivers COP 2.5–4.5, meaning it produces 2.5–4.5 units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Heating Efficiency Comparison"
  headers={["System", "Efficiency Metric", "COP Equivalent", "Cost per 100,000 BTU*"]}
  rows={[
    ["Heat Pump (HSPF2 10)", "HSPF2 10", "COP 2.93", "$1.40"],
    ["Heat Pump (HSPF2 8)", "HSPF2 8", "COP 2.34", "$1.75"],
    ["Gas Furnace (96% AFUE)", "96% AFUE", "COP 0.96", "$1.35"],
    ["Gas Furnace (80% AFUE)", "80% AFUE", "COP 0.80", "$1.63"],
    ["Electric Resistance", "100%", "COP 1.00", "$4.10"],
    ["Oil Furnace (85% AFUE)", "85% AFUE", "COP 0.85", "$3.50"],
  ]}
/>

*Assumes $0.14/kWh, $1.30/therm gas, $3.50/gal oil.*

At current national average rates, a heat pump with HSPF2 10 heats for about the same cost per BTU as a 96% gas furnace. But the heat pump also eliminates the gas service charge ($10–$20/month) and provides cooling — making it the more economical total system.

## Lifespan and Maintenance 

### Lifespan

A central AC condenser lasts 15–20 years. A heat pump outdoor unit also lasts 15–20 years. The difference is cumulative runtime: the heat pump runs year-round (heating + cooling), logging 2,500–4,500 hours annually, while the AC runs only during the cooling season (1,000–2,000 hours).

A gas furnace typically lasts 20–30 years. So if you install an AC + furnace at the same time, you'll likely replace the AC once during the furnace's lifetime. With a heat pump, you replace the single system every 15–20 years.

<ComparisonTable
  title="30-Year Equipment Replacement Cost Comparison"
  headers={["Timeline", "Heat Pump System", "AC + Gas Furnace"]}
  rows={[
    ["Year 0 (initial install)", "$7,500", "$8,000"],
    ["Year 17 (replace HP or AC)", "$8,500 (new HP)", "$5,000 (new AC only)"],
    ["Year 25 (replace furnace)", "—", "$4,000 (new furnace)"],
    ["30-year equipment total", "$16,000", "$17,000"],
    ["30-year operating cost*", "$29,000", "$38,000"],
    ["30-year total ownership", "$45,000", "$55,000"],
  ]}
/>

*Assumes current rates with 2% annual escalation. Zone 4, 2,000 sq ft.*

### Maintenance

Both systems require the same basic maintenance: annual professional tune-up ($80–$200), monthly filter changes, and outdoor unit cleaning. The heat pump's additional maintenance need is related to the reversing valve and defrost system — checked during the annual service call at no extra cost.

The AC + furnace combo requires separate maintenance: one tune-up for the AC in spring and one for the furnace in fall. Some contractors offer combo service plans. The furnace also needs periodic heat exchanger inspection (critical for safety, as a cracked heat exchanger can leak carbon monoxide).

<Callout type="info">
**Safety Advantage:** A heat pump eliminates the risk of carbon monoxide leaks, gas line leaks, and combustion-related hazards entirely. If your home has gas appliances, you should have CO detectors regardless — but a heat pump removes one potential source.
</Callout>

## When to Choose a Heat Pump 

A heat pump is the better choice when:

**You're replacing both your AC and furnace at the same time.** The cost difference is minimal (or the heat pump is cheaper after incentives), and you get lower operating costs from day one.

**You currently heat with oil, propane, or electric resistance.** Savings of $1,000–$2,000/year make the heat pump pay for itself in 2–5 years.

**Your state offers strong heat pump incentives.** In Massachusetts, Maine, New York, California, and many other states, stacked incentives make the heat pump cheaper than a furnace + AC.

**You want to simplify your HVAC.** One system, one annual maintenance visit, one set of controls. No gas line, no combustion venting, no carbon monoxide risk.

**You want to reduce your carbon footprint.** A heat pump eliminates direct fossil fuel combustion in your home. Even if your electricity comes from the grid, the COP of 2.5–4.0 means lower net emissions than a gas furnace in all but the most coal-heavy grids.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Nashville, TN:** The Williams family needed to replace both their 18-year-old AC and 22-year-old gas furnace. They got quotes for both options: AC + furnace at $8,200 installed, heat pump at $8,900 installed. After the $2,000 federal tax credit, the heat pump was $1,300 cheaper. First-year operating savings: $450. The heat pump was the obvious choice.
</Callout>

## When to Choose an Air Conditioner 

An air conditioner (paired with a furnace) may be better when:

**Your gas furnace is relatively new (under 8 years old) and only the AC needs replacing.** Installing just an AC costs $3,500–$6,000 versus $5,800–$10,000 for a complete heat pump system. There's no financial reason to replace a working furnace.

**Your electricity is very expensive (above $0.22/kWh) and gas is very cheap (below $0.90/therm).** At those rates, the gas furnace has slightly lower heating operating costs.

**You live in an extremely hot, dry climate and rarely heat.** In Phoenix or Las Vegas, the heating season is minimal. The small operating cost savings from the heat pump may not justify even the modest upfront premium.

**Your home can't support the electrical load.** If a panel upgrade is required and you can't afford it, an AC replacement with your existing furnace avoids the electrical work.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Scottsdale, AZ:** The Patel family's 5-year-old 96% AFUE gas furnace was running fine, but their 14-year-old AC was failing. They chose a new Trane AC (SEER2 18) at $4,200 installed rather than a full heat pump at $8,500. With only 500 heating degree days in Phoenix, the heat pump's heating savings would have been under $150/year — a 28-year payback on the $4,300 difference.

## Key Takeaways

In cooling mode, heat pumps and ACs perform identically at the same SEER2 rating. The heat pump adds heating capability via a reversing valve, eliminating the need for a separate furnace. After tax credits, a heat pump often costs **less** than an AC + furnace combo. Annual operating savings average **$200–$500** versus gas and **$1,000–$2,000** versus oil or propane. Choose a heat pump when replacing both heating and cooling equipment, or when switching from expensive fuel. Choose an AC when only your cooling system needs replacement and your furnace is still in good shape.

<FAQ id="faq">
  <FAQ.Item question="Is a heat pump just an air conditioner that can heat?">
    Essentially, yes. A heat pump contains all the same components as a central AC (compressor, condenser, evaporator, expansion valve) plus a reversing valve that lets the refrigerant cycle run in both directions. In cooling mode, it's identical to an AC. In heating mode, it reverses the cycle to move heat from outdoor air into your home.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Does a heat pump cool as well as an AC?">
    Yes. At the same SEER2 rating, a heat pump and an AC deliver identical cooling performance, dehumidification, and energy consumption. There is no cooling performance penalty for choosing a heat pump. Some older myths suggested heat pumps were worse at cooling, but this hasn't been true since the technology matured in the 1990s.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is a heat pump more expensive than an air conditioner?">
    The heat pump equipment costs about $500–$1,500 more than a comparable AC unit. However, the heat pump eliminates the need for a separate furnace ($2,000–$4,500). When comparing total system costs (heat pump vs. AC + furnace), the heat pump is often the same price or cheaper, especially after the $2,000 federal tax credit.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can I replace my AC with a heat pump?">
    Yes. If your air handler or furnace is compatible, you can often replace just the outdoor AC unit with a heat pump outdoor unit, using the same refrigerant lines and indoor components. This is called a "drop-in replacement" and costs $3,500–$7,000 installed. Your contractor will verify compatibility.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do I still need a furnace with a heat pump?">
    In climate zones 1–4 (most of the southern and central U.S.), a properly sized heat pump handles 100% of heating and cooling with no furnace needed. In zones 5–7 (northern states), you can keep your gas furnace as a backup for extreme cold days (a "dual-fuel" system) or choose a cold-climate heat pump that handles the full load alone.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Which lasts longer — a heat pump or an AC?">
    Both last 15–20 years on average. The AC runs fewer total hours per year (cooling season only vs. year-round for the heat pump), which can slightly extend its lifespan. However, a gas furnace paired with an AC lasts 20–30 years. Over 30 years, you might replace a heat pump twice versus replacing an AC once and a furnace once — the total equipment cost is comparable.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Should I get a heat pump or AC in Florida?">
    A heat pump is generally the better choice in Florida. The climate is warm enough that the heat pump operates at high efficiency year-round (COP 3.5+ for the mild heating season). It eliminates the need for a separate heating system, saves on operating costs, and qualifies for the $2,000 federal tax credit. The only reason to choose AC-only is if you already have a working furnace or heat strips and only need to replace the cooling equipment.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What's the difference between a heat pump and a mini split?">
    A mini split is a type of heat pump — specifically, a ductless heat pump. "Heat pump" is a broad category that includes ducted (whole-home) systems and ductless (mini split) systems. Ducted heat pumps use your home's ductwork to distribute air. Mini splits connect an outdoor unit directly to wall-mounted indoor heads via refrigerant lines, requiring no ductwork.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can a heat pump replace a window AC unit?">
    Yes. A ductless mini split heat pump is the ideal upgrade from window AC units. A single-zone mini split costs $2,700–$5,800 installed, provides both heating and cooling, runs at 19–32 dB (versus 50–65 dB for a window AC), is 2–3× more efficient, and doesn't block your window. It's one of the best home comfort upgrades available.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do heat pumps use more electricity than air conditioners?">
    In cooling mode, they use exactly the same amount — they're identical. Over the full year, a heat pump uses more total electricity because it also handles heating (which an AC doesn't do). However, the heat pump's total energy cost (all-electric) is usually lower than an AC + gas furnace's total energy cost (electricity + gas).
