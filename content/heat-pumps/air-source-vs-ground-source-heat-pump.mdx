# Air-Source vs Ground-Source Heat Pump: Full Comparison

An air-source heat pump costs $5,800–$10,000 installed, operates at COP 2.5–4.5, and lasts 15–20 years. A ground-source (geothermal) heat pump costs $18,000–$35,000 installed, operates at COP 3.5–5.0 year-round regardless of outdoor temperature, and lasts 20–25 years (with a ground loop lasting 50+ years). Both are far more efficient than gas furnaces, but they serve different homeowner needs.

The short answer: choose air-source if you want lower upfront cost and faster payback. Choose ground-source if you're building new, planning to stay 15+ years, want maximum efficiency, or live in a climate with extreme temperature swings.

## How Each System Works 

### Air-Source

An air-source heat pump exchanges heat between the indoor air and the outdoor air using a refrigerant cycle. The outdoor unit absorbs heat from outdoor air in winter (even cold air) and rejects heat to outdoor air in summer. Since outdoor air temperature varies from −15 °F to 115 °F+ depending on your location and season, the system's efficiency varies with conditions.

### Ground-Source (Geothermal)

A ground-source heat pump exchanges heat with the earth instead of the air. Buried pipes (the "ground loop") circulate a water-antifreeze solution underground, where the temperature remains stable at 45–65 °F year-round (depending on latitude and depth). This stable temperature source is the geothermal system's key advantage — it doesn't matter if it's −20 °F or 105 °F outside; the ground loop provides a consistent, moderate-temperature heat exchange medium.

There are three main loop configurations. A **horizontal loop** uses trenches 4–6 feet deep across 400–600 linear feet per ton — requiring a large, flat yard. A **vertical loop** drills boreholes 150–200 feet deep per ton — works in smaller yards. An **open loop** pumps groundwater directly through the heat exchanger, requiring an adequate well and a discharge point (like a return well or pond).

<Callout type="info">
**Why Geothermal Is More Efficient:** An air-source heat pump at 0 °F must extract heat from air that's 70 degrees colder than your indoor target. A geothermal system extracts heat from the ground at 50 °F — only 20 degrees colder. Less temperature difference means less compressor work, which means higher COP.
</Callout>

## Efficiency Comparison by Temperature 

The efficiency gap between air-source and ground-source grows as outdoor conditions become more extreme.

    ["-15 °F", "Off or 1.0", "1.2–1.5", "3.8–5.0", "+250–400%"],
  ]}
/>

The ground-source system is most advantageous in extreme climates — both very cold winters and very hot summers. In mild climates (zone 3–4), the efficiency advantage exists but is smaller, making the payback period on the higher upfront cost longer.

*25-year comparison assumes one air-source replacement at year 17 ($6,000–$8,000) but geothermal equipment still running. **30-year comparison assumes two air-source replacements but only one geothermal equipment replacement (ground loop still original).*

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Boise, ID (Zone 5):** The Chen family compared quotes for a 3-ton system. Air-source (Bosch IDS 2.0): $8,400 installed ($6,400 after 25C credit). Geothermal (ClimateMaster Tranquility): $26,000 installed ($18,200 after 25D credit). Annual operating cost difference: $350/year in favor of geothermal. Payback on the $11,800 upfront difference: 34 years. They chose air-source. Had they been building new (with geothermal loop costs 40% lower), payback would have been 18 years, and they might have chosen differently.

## Installation Requirements 

<ComparisonTable
  title="Installation Requirements Comparison"
  headers={["Requirement", "Air-Source", "Ground-Source"]}
  rows={[
    ["Outdoor space", "4×4 ft pad for outdoor unit", "Large yard (horizontal) or drill access (vertical)"],
    ["Indoor space", "Air handler closet/utility room", "Similar — slightly larger indoor unit"],
    ["Electrical", "30–50A 240V circuit", "30–50A 240V circuit"],
    ["Ductwork", "Uses existing or add new", "Uses existing or add new"],
    ["Permits", "HVAC permit", "HVAC + drilling/excavation permit"],
    ["Installation time", "1–2 days", "1–2 weeks"],
    ["Disruption", "Minimal", "Significant (trenching/drilling yard)"],
    ["HOA concerns", "Outdoor unit visible", "None after install (all underground)"],
    ["Property restoration", "None", "Yard re-grading and re-seeding"],
  ]}
/>

The biggest barrier to geothermal is the ground loop installation. Horizontal loops require 400–600 feet of trench per ton (1,200–1,800 feet for a 3-ton system) at 4–6 feet deep, which means tearing up a significant portion of your yard. Vertical loops require a drilling rig and boreholes 150–200 feet deep per ton. In both cases, the yard will need restoration after installation.

For new construction, loop installation is far less expensive because the excavation equipment is already on-site and the yard hasn't been landscaped yet. This is why geothermal is most commonly recommended for new builds.

## Climate Performance 

<ComparisonTable
  title="Best System by Climate Zone"
  headers={["Climate Zone", "Air-Source Performance", "Geothermal Performance", "Recommended System"]}
  rows={[
    ["Zone 1–2 (Hot)", "Excellent cooling, minimal heating needed", "Excellent, but low heating savings", "Air-source (geothermal ROI too long)"],
    ["Zone 3 (Warm)", "Very good year-round", "Very good, moderate advantage", "Air-source (unless new build)"],

    ["Zone 7 (Very Cold)", "Requires cold-climate model + backup", "Excellent regardless of temps", "Geothermal ideal; cold-climate AS + dual-fuel"],
  ]}
/>

## Lifespan and Maintenance 

Geothermal systems win on longevity. The indoor heat pump equipment lasts 20–25 years, and the ground loop itself has a lifespan exceeding 50 years (some installed in the 1970s are still functioning). Air-source heat pumps last 15–20 years.

Geothermal maintenance is also simpler and cheaper. There's no outdoor unit to maintain, no defrost cycles, no outdoor coil to clean, and no exposure to weather or debris. Annual maintenance focuses on checking the circulating pump, verifying antifreeze concentration in the ground loop, and standard indoor coil/filter service. Typical cost: $50–$150 per year versus $80–$200 for air-source.

## Tax Credits and Incentives 

<ComparisonTable
  title="Federal Tax Credit Comparison"
  headers={["Feature", "Air-Source (25C)", "Ground-Source (25D)"]}
  rows={[
    ["Credit rate", "30%", "30%"],
    ["Maximum credit", "$2,000/year", "No cap"],
    ["$30,000 system credit", "$2,000", "$9,000"],
    ["Available through", "2032", "2032 (26% in 2033, 22% in 2034)"],
    ["Primary residence only?", "Yes", "Yes"],
    ["Nonrefundable?", "Yes", "Yes (but can carry forward)"],
  ]}
/>

The uncapped 25D credit is a major financial advantage for geothermal. A $30,000 geothermal system receives a $9,000 credit, while a $10,000 air-source system is capped at $2,000. Combined with state incentives (many states offer additional geothermal rebates of $1,000–$5,000), the effective cost gap narrows substantially.

## Key Takeaways

Air-source heat pumps cost **$5,800–$10,000** installed; ground-source costs **$18,000–$35,000**. After tax credits, the gap narrows to roughly **$3,800–$8,000 vs. $12,600–$24,500**. Ground-source operates at **COP 3.5–5.0 year-round**, unaffected by outdoor temperature — a huge advantage in zones 5–7. Air-source with cold-climate technology closes much of the efficiency gap at moderate cost. Ground-source equipment lasts **20–25 years** with a **50+ year ground loop**, versus 15–20 years for air-source. For most existing homes, **air-source offers better ROI** (faster payback). For new construction, homes in extreme climates, or 15+ year stays, **geothermal is the superior long-term investment**.

<FAQ id="faq">
  <FAQ.Item question="Is geothermal worth the extra cost?">
    For new construction, usually yes — the ground loop installation is 30–40% cheaper when the site is already excavated. For existing homes, it depends on your climate, how long you plan to stay, and available incentives. In zones 5–7 with a 20+ year stay, geothermal's lower operating costs and longer lifespan often justify the premium. In mild climates or for stays under 15 years, air-source provides better ROI.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How long does a geothermal system last?">
    The indoor heat pump equipment lasts 20–25 years — about 5 years longer than air-source. The ground loop (buried pipes) lasts 50+ years with no maintenance. Some ground loops installed in the 1970s are still functioning perfectly. Over 50 years, you'll replace the indoor equipment 2–3 times while keeping the same ground loop.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can you install geothermal in an existing home?">
    Yes, but it's more expensive and disruptive than new construction. The ground loop installation requires trenching or drilling, which means significant yard disruption. Vertical bore loops minimize yard impact but cost more. The indoor equipment installation is similar to air-source. Total installed cost for retrofit is typically $22,000–$35,000 for a 3-ton system.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does geothermal save per year?">
    Compared to a gas furnace + AC, geothermal saves $560–$1,000 per year on energy costs (zone 4–5, 2,000 sq ft home). Compared to oil or propane, savings are $1,500–$2,500/year. Compared to a cold-climate air-source heat pump, savings are $200–$400/year. The largest savings come from cold climates where the geothermal system maintains high COP while air-source efficiency drops.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is geothermal quieter than air-source?">
    Yes, significantly. Geothermal has no outdoor unit, so outdoor noise is zero. The indoor unit produces the same noise as an air-source indoor unit (35–50 dB). There are no defrost cycles, no outdoor fan, and no compressor noise audible from outside the home. This makes geothermal ideal for noise-sensitive neighborhoods, properties close to neighbors, or HOA-restricted areas.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What's the geothermal tax credit for 2026?">
    Geothermal heat pumps qualify for the Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit — 30% of the total installed cost with NO cap. A $30,000 geothermal system generates a $9,000 tax credit. This is more generous than the air-source 25C credit, which is capped at $2,000. The 25D credit runs at 30% through 2032, then drops to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do ground-source heat pumps work in cold climates?">
    Yes — they excel in cold climates. Ground temperature remains 45–55 °F year-round (at depth) even when the air temperature is −20 °F. A geothermal system maintains COP 3.5–4.5 regardless of outdoor conditions, while an air-source system drops to COP 1.5–2.0 at −15 °F. Geothermal is the ideal technology for climate zones 5–7 if budget allows.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much land do you need for geothermal?">
    For a horizontal loop (3-ton system): approximately 1,200–1,800 linear feet of trench, typically in a serpentine pattern across 3,000–5,000 sq ft of yard space. For a vertical loop: 3 boreholes 150–200 ft deep, requiring only a small drilling area (but drill rig access). Vertical is more common in suburban settings where yard space is limited.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can geothermal provide hot water too?">
    Yes. Many geothermal systems include a "desuperheater" — a secondary heat exchanger that captures waste heat from the refrigerant cycle and uses it to preheat your domestic hot water. This can reduce water heating costs by 40–60% at essentially zero additional operating cost. Some systems can provide full water heating through a dedicated water heating loop.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Air-source or geothermal for a new build?">
    For new construction, geothermal deserves serious consideration. Ground loop installation costs are 30–40% lower when the site is already being excavated. The 30% uncapped tax credit (25D) significantly reduces the cost gap. You'll benefit from the system's full 50+ year loop lifespan. If your budget is tight, a cold-climate air-source heat pump is still an excellent choice — just not quite as efficient over the system's lifetime.
