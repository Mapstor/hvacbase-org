The biggest savings versus gas happen during shoulder months (March, April, October, November) when the heat pump runs at high COP (3.5–4.5) and gas furnaces still cycle at full blast for relatively mild temperatures.

## Heat Pump vs Gas Furnace Running Costs 

This is the comparison most homeowners need. The answer depends entirely on your local electricity and gas rates.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Annual Running Cost: Heat Pump vs Gas Furnace + AC (2,000 sq ft, Zone 4)"
  headers={["Scenario", "Heat Pump Cost", "Gas + AC Cost", "Annual Savings", "HP Wins?"]}

/>

<Callout type="important">
**The Crossover Point:** A heat pump's running costs are lower than gas in about 85% of U.S. markets. The heat pump loses only when electricity exceeds approximately $0.20/kWh AND gas is below $1.00/therm simultaneously. This combination exists in parts of the Northeast and some deregulated Texas markets.

## Heat Pump vs Oil and Propane Costs 

If you currently heat with oil or propane, the savings from switching to a heat pump are substantial.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Annual Cost Comparison: Heat Pump vs Oil/Propane (2,000 sq ft, Zone 5)"
  headers={["Fuel Type", "Annual Heating + Cooling Cost", "Heat Pump Cost", "Annual Savings"]}
  rows={[
    ["Heating Oil ($3.50/gal) + AC", "$2,310", "$882", "$1,428"],
    ["Heating Oil ($4.50/gal) + AC", "$2,790", "$882", "$1,908"],
    ["Propane ($2.50/gal) + AC", "$2,095", "$882", "$1,213"],

    ["Electric Baseboard (no AC)", "$2,520", "$882", "$1,638"],
  ]}
/>

For oil and propane users, the heat pump typically pays for itself in 3–5 years — before accounting for any tax credits or rebates.

## Electricity Rate Impact 

Since the heat pump runs entirely on electricity, your local rate has a direct, linear impact on running costs. Here's how the same system's annual cost changes across the range of U.S. electricity rates.

  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**Time-of-Use Rates Can Help:** Many utilities offer time-of-use (TOU) rate plans where electricity is cheaper during off-peak hours (typically 9 PM – 7 AM). Since heat pumps run heaviest in the morning and evening, programming your thermostat to pre-heat or pre-cool during off-peak hours can reduce costs by 10–20%.
</Callout>

## How to Lower Your Heat Pump Running Costs 

These strategies can reduce your running costs by 15–35%, saving $150–$500 per year.

**Smart thermostat setbacks:** Drop temperatures 2–3 °F while sleeping or away. Inverter heat pumps respond best to small setbacks — avoid large swings (5+ °F) that trigger recovery mode. Expected savings: 8–15%.

**Seal air leaks and insulate.** The most cost-effective improvement. Focus on attic insulation (add to R-49 or R-60), basement rim joists, and weatherstripping around doors and windows. Typical cost: $500–$3,000. Expected savings: 15–25% on heating costs.

**Keep filters clean.** A clogged filter increases electricity usage by 5–15%. Check monthly; replace every 1–3 months. Cost: $5–$15 per filter.

**Annual professional maintenance.** A technician checks refrigerant charge, cleans coils, and verifies system operation. Cost: $80–$200. Expected savings: 5–10% by maintaining peak efficiency.

**Use ceiling fans to distribute air.** In heating mode, reverse your ceiling fan to push warm air down from the ceiling. This lets you lower the thermostat by 1–2 °F while maintaining the same comfort level.

**Switch to a time-of-use rate plan.** If your utility offers TOU pricing, schedule your heating and cooling during off-peak hours. Pre-heat the house in the early morning before peak rates kick in. Expected savings: 10–20%.

<FAQ id="faq">
  <FAQ.Item question="How much does a heat pump cost to run per month?">
    The average heat pump costs $41–$104 per month depending on climate zone, with the U.S. average around $62/month for a 2,000 sq ft home. Winter months are higher ($100–$135/month in zone 4) and summer months lower ($55–$90/month). Transition months (April, October) can be as low as $28–$49/month.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is it expensive to run a heat pump all day?">
    Modern inverter heat pumps are designed to run continuously at low power, which is actually more efficient than cycling on and off. Running all day at 30–50% capacity costs less than running at 100% for half the day. A 3-ton inverter heat pump running continuously in moderate weather (40–55 °F) draws about 1.0–1.5 kW, costing $0.14–$0.21 per hour or $3.36–$5.04 per day.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does a heat pump increase your electric bill?">
    If switching from a gas furnace, expect your electric bill to increase by $40–$80/month in winter while your gas bill drops to zero. The net savings are typically $40–$100/month overall. If switching from electric resistance heat, your electric bill will decrease since the heat pump is 2.5–4× more efficient.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What is the cheapest temperature to set a heat pump?">
    Every degree lower you set the thermostat saves approximately 3% on heating costs. The cheapest comfortable setting for most people is 68 °F while awake and 62–65 °F while sleeping. With an inverter heat pump, avoid setting back more than 3–5 °F, as larger recovery periods reduce efficiency. In cooling mode, 76–78 °F is the most economical setting.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is a heat pump cheaper to run than a gas furnace?">
    In most U.S. markets (about 85%), yes. At the national average rates of $0.14/kWh electricity and $1.30/therm gas, a heat pump saves $400–$600 per year versus a gas furnace + AC. The heat pump loses only when electricity exceeds $0.20/kWh and gas is below $1.00/therm simultaneously.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does it cost to run a mini split per month?">
    A single-zone 12K BTU mini split costs $18–$45 per month depending on climate and usage. A 4-zone whole-home mini split system costs $60–$130 per month. Mini splits are 10–30% cheaper to run than ducted heat pumps because they eliminate duct losses.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Does a heat pump use less electricity than baseboard heaters?">
    Yes — dramatically. A heat pump uses 60–75% less electricity than baseboard heaters to produce the same amount of heat. Baseboard heaters have a COP of 1.0 (one unit of heat per unit of electricity). A heat pump has a COP of 2.5–4.5 (2.5–4.5 units of heat per unit of electricity). Switching from baseboard to a heat pump typically saves $1,000–$2,000 per year.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does emergency heat cost to run?">
    Emergency heat (electric resistance strips) costs 2.5–4× more than normal heat pump operation. A 10 kW strip running for 8 hours costs $11.20 at $0.14/kWh. The same heating from a heat pump at COP 3.0 costs about $3.73. Never leave emergency heat on unless the heat pump compressor has actually failed — it's the most expensive way to heat your home.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can solar panels eliminate heat pump running costs?">
    A properly sized solar array (6–10 kW) can produce enough annual electricity to offset 100% of a heat pump's consumption. With net metering, excess summer production credits offset winter usage. The net annual heat pump running cost with solar can be $0 or close to it. Combined with the 30% solar tax credit and the heat pump tax credit, the payback period for both investments together is typically 6–10 years.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Why is my heat pump costing more to run than expected?">
    Common causes include backup strip heat activating too frequently (check the "aux heat" indicator), a dirty air filter restricting airflow, thermostat set too high, poor insulation causing excessive heating load, low refrigerant charge, ductwork leaks losing 20–30% of conditioned air, or the system being oversized and short-cycling. Start with the filter, then schedule a maintenance check.
