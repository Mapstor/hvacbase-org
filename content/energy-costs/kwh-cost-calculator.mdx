</Callout>

## The kWh Cost Formula

The math is straightforward:

**Cost = kWh × Price per kWh**

For an appliance with a known wattage:

**Cost = (Watts × Hours Used) ÷ 1,000 × Price per kWh**

For example, a 1,500W space heater running for 8 hours at $0.168/kWh:

(1,500 × 8) ÷ 1,000 × $0.168 = 12 kWh × $0.168 = **$2.02**

Run that heater 8 hours daily for a month (30 days), and you're looking at 360 kWh × $0.168 = **$60.48/month**.

### Converting Watts to kWh

One kWh equals 1,000 watts running for one hour. To convert any appliance from watts to kWh:

**kWh = Watts × Hours ÷ 1,000**

| Appliance | Watts | Hours/Day | Daily kWh | Monthly kWh |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LED Light Bulb | 10W | 5 | 0.05 | 1.5 |
| Laptop Computer | 50W | 8 | 0.4 | 12 |

## What Does 1 kWh Actually Power?

One kWh is an abstract concept until you see it in real-world terms. Here's what a single kilowatt-hour can do:

| 1 kWh Powers... | Duration |
|---|---|
| A 10W LED light bulb | 100 hours |
| A 60W incandescent bulb | 16.7 hours |
| A ceiling fan on medium | 15 hours |
| A laptop computer | 20 hours |
| A 55" LED TV | 17 hours |
| A microwave oven (1,000W) | 1 hour |
| A hair dryer (1,875W) | 32 minutes |
| A space heater (1,500W) | 40 minutes |
| A clothes dryer (3,000W) | 20 minutes |
| An electric vehicle | ~3-4 miles of driving |

At the national average of $0.168/kWh, each of these scenarios costs you about **17 cents**. In Hawaii, that same kWh costs 42 cents. In Idaho, just 10.5 cents.

| Pool Pump (1.5 HP) | 3,000 | $504 | $42 |
| Hot Tub | 2,500 | $420 | $35 |

## Real-World Cost Calculation Examples

### Example 1: How Much Does Running the AC Cost Per Hour?

You have a 3-ton central air conditioner rated at 14 SEER in Texas (rate: $0.142/kWh).

A 3-ton AC at 14 SEER draws approximately 2,571 watts (36,000 BTU ÷ 14 SEER = 2,571W).

- **Per hour:** 2.57 kWh × $0.142 = **$0.37/hour**
- **Per day (8 hours runtime):** 20.6 kWh × $0.142 = **$2.92/day**
- **Per month (peak summer):** 617 kWh × $0.142 = **$87.59/month**
- **Per cooling season (6 months):** ~2,400 kWh × $0.142 = **$340.80/season**

### Example 2: Is a Space Heater Cheaper Than Cranking Up the Furnace?

You're in Ohio ($0.146/kWh, gas rate $1.15/therm) and wondering if a 1,500W space heater for your home office beats raising the whole-house thermostat.

**Space heater (one room, 8 hours):** 12 kWh × $0.146 = **$1.75/day**

**Furnace (80% AFUE, raising temp 2°F for whole 2,000 sq ft house):** Approximately 0.8 therms/day × $1.15 ÷ 0.80 = **$1.15/day**

In this scenario, the furnace is actually cheaper for the whole house. But if you're only occupying one room and can lower the thermostat 5°F while running the space heater, the heater wins: $1.75 for the heater vs. the furnace savings of $2.88/day from the setback, netting $1.13/day in savings.

### Example 3: Electric vs. Gas Water Heating Monthly Cost

For a family of four using 64 gallons of hot water per day in Massachusetts ($0.286/kWh, $1.85/therm).

**Standard electric tank (EF 0.92):** ~400 kWh/month × $0.286 = **$114.40/month**

**Gas tank (EF 0.62):** ~30 therms/month × $1.85 ÷ 0.62 = **$89.52/month**

**Heat pump water heater (UEF 3.5):** ~114 kWh/month × $0.286 = **$32.60/month**

The heat pump water heater saves over $80/month compared to the standard electric tank and over $55/month compared to gas. See our [electric water heating cost by state](/electric-water-heating-cost-by-state) for detailed analysis.

### Example 4: What Does an EV Charger Add to Your Electric Bill?

You drive 1,000 miles/month in an EV averaging 3.5 miles/kWh, charging at home in California ($0.276/kWh peak, $0.14/kWh off-peak TOU).

**At peak rates:** 286 kWh × $0.276 = **$78.94/month**

**At off-peak TOU rates:** 286 kWh × $0.14 = **$40.04/month**

**Gasoline equivalent (30 MPG, $4.50/gal):** 33.3 gal × $4.50 = **$149.85/month**

Even at California peak rates, the EV costs roughly half as much as gasoline. At off-peak TOU rates, it's about 73% cheaper. This is why [time-of-use rates](/time-of-use-rates-explained) matter enormously for EV owners.

## Understanding Your Electricity Bill Line Items

Your bill includes more than just the per-kWh charge. Here's what each component means:

| Line Item | What It Is | Typical Range |
|---|---|---|
| Energy/Generation Charge | Cost of producing the electricity | 60–70% of total |
| Transmission Charge | Moving power from plants to substations | 5–10% of total |
| Distribution Charge | Delivering power from substations to your home | 15–20% of total |
| Customer Charge | Fixed monthly service fee | $5–$20/month |
| Fuel Adjustment | Pass-through of fuel cost changes | Variable |
| Renewable Energy Charge | Funding for renewable programs | $2–$10/month |
| Taxes & Fees | State, local taxes, regulatory fees | 5–12% of total |

<Callout type="warning">
When calculating your "true" cost per kWh, divide your **total bill** (minus any fixed monthly charges) by your **total kWh used**. This gives you your "all-in" effective rate, which is usually 10–20% higher than the advertised energy rate alone.
</Callout>

## How kWh Costs Compare Across Energy Sources

When evaluating whether to go electric, gas, propane, or solar, you need to compare costs on an equal footing. The standard comparison unit is cost per million BTU delivered.

| Energy Source | 2026 Avg Price | Efficiency | Effective Cost/MMBTU |
|---|---|---|---|
| Natural Gas (furnace) | $1.22/therm | 96% AFUE | $12.71 |
| Natural Gas (furnace, old) | $1.22/therm | 80% AFUE | $15.25 |
| Electricity (resistance heat) | $0.168/kWh | 100% | $49.24 |
| Electricity (heat pump, COP 3.0) | $0.168/kWh | 300% | $16.41 |
| Electricity (heat pump, COP 4.0) | $0.168/kWh | 400% | $12.31 |
| Propane | $2.85/gallon | 95% AFUE | $32.75 |
| Heating Oil | $3.95/gallon | 85% AFUE | $33.50 |
| Wood Pellets | $280/ton | 80% | $21.34 |

This table reveals why heat pumps are transforming the economics of home heating. At a COP of 4.0 (common for modern cold-climate heat pumps at moderate temperatures), electricity through a heat pump is actually **cheaper per BTU than natural gas** — even at the national average electric rate.

## Tips for Reducing Your Cost Per kWh

You can't always control your utility's rate, but you can effectively reduce what you pay per kWh through several strategies.

**Switch to a TOU plan.** If your utility offers time-of-use pricing, shifting major loads to off-peak hours (nights, weekends) can cut your effective rate by 15–25%. This works especially well if you can charge EVs, run dishwashers, and do laundry during off-peak windows.

**Install solar panels.** A solar system produces electricity at an effective cost of $0.04–$0.08/kWh over its 25-year life, well below any utility rate. With net metering, excess production offsets your bill at retail rates.

**Negotiate your rate.** In deregulated states (Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and others), you can shop for competitive electricity suppliers. Comparison sites like EnergySage, Power to Choose (TX), and PA Power Switch let you find lower rates.

**Reduce consumption in expensive tiers.** If you're on a tiered rate plan, every kWh you save comes off the most expensive tier first. Cutting 200 kWh/month from a tiered plan might save $0.25/kWh on those kilowatt-hours — far more than the average rate suggests.

**Participate in demand response.** Many utilities offer bill credits ($50–$200/year) for allowing brief, controlled adjustments to your AC during peak demand events. You typically won't notice the difference, but the credits add up.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How do I calculate kWh from watts?",
    answer: "Divide the wattage by 1,000 and multiply by the hours of use. Formula: kWh = (Watts × Hours) ÷ 1,000. For example, a 100-watt light bulb running for 10 hours uses (100 × 10) ÷ 1,000 = 1 kWh. To find the cost, multiply the kWh by your electricity rate: 1 kWh × $0.168 = $0.168 or about 17 cents."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a good price per kWh for electricity?",
    answer: "The national average is about 16.8¢/kWh in 2026. Rates below 12¢/kWh are considered cheap (common in the Pacific Northwest and parts of the Great Plains), 12–17¢ is average, 17–25¢ is above average, and above 25¢ is expensive (common in New England, California, and Hawaii). However, a 'good' rate depends on your location — 15¢ is great in Massachusetts but high for Washington state."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run a 1,500 watt space heater for 24 hours?",
    answer: "At the national average of $0.168/kWh: 1,500W × 24 hours ÷ 1,000 = 36 kWh × $0.168 = $6.05 per day. Over a month, that's $181.44. Space heaters are the most expensive form of electric heating on a whole-home basis, but can be economical for heating a single room while lowering the thermostat for the rest of the house."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does 1,000 kWh of electricity cost?",
    answer: "At the US average rate of 16.8¢/kWh, 1,000 kWh costs $168. However, this varies enormously by state: $105 in Idaho, $168 in the national average, $276 in California, and $421 in Hawaii. If you're on a tiered rate plan, the first 500 kWh might cost less than the second 500 kWh, so your per-kWh cost isn't uniform across all usage."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is my electricity rate different from the state average?",
    answer: "Several factors cause individual rates to differ from state averages. Your specific utility company may charge more or less than others in the state. Your rate plan (flat, tiered, or TOU) affects your effective rate. Additional charges like fuel adjustments, renewable energy surcharges, and demand charges vary. Deregulated states have multiple competing suppliers with different rates. Also, the 'state average' includes all rate classes — your residential rate may differ from the blended average."
  },
  {
    question: "How many kWh does the average house use per month?",
    answer: "The average US household uses approximately 886 kWh per month (10,632 kWh per year). This varies significantly by state: Louisiana averages 1,140 kWh/month while Hawaii averages 515 kWh/month. Home size, climate, heating fuel type, and appliance efficiency all affect your usage. See our detailed breakdown at how many kWh per day is normal."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the cheapest way to heat with electricity?",
    answer: "A heat pump is by far the cheapest way to heat with electricity. A modern heat pump delivers 2.5–4.0 units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed, making it 250–400% efficient. At $0.168/kWh, a heat pump with COP 3.0 costs about $16.41 per million BTU — comparable to natural gas at $1.22/therm. Resistance heating (space heaters, baseboard heaters) costs $49.24 per million BTU — about 3x more than a heat pump."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the kWh cost include delivery charges?",
    answer: "The advertised 'energy charge' or 'generation charge' on your bill typically does NOT include delivery charges. Your true all-in rate includes generation (60–70%), transmission (5–10%), distribution (15–20%), and taxes/fees (5–12%). To find your all-in rate, divide your total bill minus any fixed monthly charges by your total kWh consumed. This rate is usually 10–20% higher than the energy charge alone."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to charge an electric vehicle at home?",
    answer: "The average EV uses about 30 kWh per 100 miles. At the national average of $0.168/kWh, that's $5.04 per 100 miles — roughly 75% cheaper than gasoline at $3.50/gallon in a 30 MPG car ($11.67 per 100 miles). For a driver covering 12,000 miles/year, that's about $605/year in electricity vs. $1,400 in gasoline. Charging on off-peak TOU rates can reduce this further to $350–$450/year."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it cheaper to run appliances at night?",
    answer: "Only if you're on a time-of-use (TOU) rate plan. On a flat-rate or tiered plan, electricity costs the same regardless of when you use it. On a TOU plan, off-peak hours (typically 9 PM – 7 AM and weekends) can be 30–50% cheaper than peak hours (2–7 PM weekdays). If you're on a TOU plan, running your dishwasher, laundry, and EV charger at night can save 15–25% on those loads."
