The average US electric bill is **$149 per month** ($1,786 per year) in 2026, based on average residential consumption of 886 kWh/month at the national average rate of 16.8 cents/kWh. However, monthly bills range from $93 in Utah to over $200 in Hawaii and Connecticut, driven by vast differences in both electricity rates and consumption patterns.

Your electric bill is determined by a simple equation: **rate x usage = bill**. Understanding both variables — and how they interact in your state — is the key to knowing whether your bill is normal and where your best savings opportunities lie.

Notice that the highest-bill states don't perfectly match the highest-rate states. Alabama ranks #3 for highest bills despite a below-average rate (14.7 cents) because consumption is enormous (1,210 kWh/month). California has the 5th-highest rate but only the 14th-highest bill because Californians use relatively little electricity.

## Bill vs. Rate: Why the Distinction Matters

This is one of the most misunderstood concepts in home energy. A high rate doesn't necessarily mean a high bill, and vice versa.

### The Two Paths to High Electric Bills

| Path | Example | Rate | Usage | Bill | Best Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| High Rate, Moderate Usage | Connecticut | 29.9 cents | 697 kWh | $208 | Reduce consumption, go solar |
| Low Rate, Very High Usage | Alabama | 14.7 cents | 1,210 kWh | $178 | Improve efficiency, reduce HVAC load |
| High Rate + High Usage | Hawaii | 42.1 cents | 515 kWh | $217 | Solar + efficiency + conservation |
| Low Rate + Low Usage | Utah | 11.2 cents | 832 kWh | $93 | Already optimal |

## Monthly Bill Variation Through the Year

Electric bills fluctuate significantly with the seasons. Your peak month might be 50% higher than your lowest month.

### National Average Monthly Electric Bill by Month (2026)

| Month | Avg Electric Bill | vs. Annual Avg | Primary Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| January | $172 | +15% | Electric heating peak |
| February | $163 | +9% | Heating |
| March | $142 | -5% | Spring transition |
| April | $126 | -15% | Mild weather |
| May | $133 | -11% | Early cooling |
| June | $154 | +3% | Cooling ramp-up |
| July | $176 | +18% | Summer peak |
| August | $180 | +21% | Summer peak |
| September | $157 | +5% | Late cooling |
| October | $131 | -12% | Fall transition |
| November | $137 | -8% | Early heating |
| December | $161 | +8% | Heating + holidays |

Your "baseline" bill in the mildest months (April, October) represents your non-HVAC electricity costs: refrigeration, lighting, cooking, electronics, and water heating. Everything above that baseline is weather-driven.

## Average Electric Bill by Home Size

| Home Size | Avg Monthly Bill | Avg Annual Bill | Per 100 sq ft |
|---|---|---|---|
| Under 1,000 sq ft | $85 | $1,020 | $8.50 |
| 1,000-1,499 sq ft | $115 | $1,380 | $8.85 |
| 1,500-1,999 sq ft | $142 | $1,704 | $8.11 |
| 2,000-2,499 sq ft | $164 | $1,968 | $7.29 |
| 2,500-2,999 sq ft | $187 | $2,244 | $6.81 |
| 3,000-3,999 sq ft | $218 | $2,616 | $6.23 |
| 4,000+ sq ft | $273 | $3,276 | $6.21 |

The per-square-foot cost actually decreases for larger homes because certain baseload items (refrigerator, water heater, lighting) don't scale linearly with home size.

## Average Electric Bill by Housing Type

| Home Type | Avg Monthly Bill | Avg Annual Bill |
|---|---|---|
| Single-family detached | $171 | $2,052 |
| Townhouse | $126 | $1,512 |
| Small apartment (2-4 units) | $97 | $1,164 |
| Large apartment (5+ units) | $77 | $924 |
| Mobile home | $140 | $1,680 |

## Real-World Bill Examples

### Example 1: Below-Average Bill — Couple in Portland, OR

**Profile:** 1,400 sq ft townhouse, gas furnace, 2 people, LED lighting. **Rate:** 12.0 cents/kWh. **Monthly usage:** 550 kWh. **Monthly bill: $66.** This is 56% below the national average — mild climate, gas heating, shared walls, efficient home, and cheap electricity all contribute.

### Example 2: Average Bill — Family of Four in Columbus, OH

**Profile:** 2,200 sq ft single-family home, gas furnace, central AC, 4 people. **Rate:** 14.6 cents/kWh. **Monthly usage:** 980 kWh. **Monthly bill: $143.** Essentially right at the national average. Summer peaks around $200; winter dips to $100.

### Example 3: High Bill — Family in Mobile, AL

**Profile:** 2,800 sq ft home, all-electric heat pump, 4 people, pool. **Rate:** 14.7 cents/kWh. **Monthly usage:** 1,450 kWh. **Monthly bill: $213.** The all-electric setup, pool pump ($55/month), and long cooling season in a hot-humid climate push this well above average.

### Example 4: Extremely High Bill — Older Home in Connecticut

**Profile:** 3,500 sq ft colonial, electric resistance heating, poor insulation, 5 people. **Rate:** 29.9 cents/kWh. **January usage:** 1,800 kWh. **January bill: $538.** Annual average: $320/month. The triple whammy of high rates, electric resistance heating, and poor insulation creates devastating winter bills. A heat pump conversion plus air sealing could cut this by 50%.

## How to Determine if Your Bill Is Too High

Here's a quick benchmarking framework:

**Step 1:** Find your state's average monthly bill in the table above.

**Step 2:** Adjust for your circumstances. Add 15% if your home is larger than average for your state. Add 30-50% if you have all-electric heating instead of gas. Add 10% for each person above 2 in your household. Add $40-60 if you have a pool pump.

**Step 3:** Compare. If your actual bill exceeds your adjusted benchmark by more than 20%, you likely have efficiency issues worth investigating. Start with a [DIY energy audit](/home-energy-audit-diy).

<Callout type="warning">
A sudden spike in your electric bill (25%+ above recent months without weather explanation) could indicate a malfunctioning appliance, HVAC problem, or even a meter error. Compare your meter reading to your bill and check if any appliances are running continuously.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "What is the average electric bill in the US in 2026?",
    answer: "The average US residential electric bill is approximately $149 per month or $1,786 per year in 2026. This is based on average consumption of 886 kWh per month at the national average rate of 16.8 cents per kWh. Actual bills vary from under $75 for efficient apartments to over $400 for large all-electric homes in extreme climates."
  },
  {
    question: "What state has the highest electric bill?",
    answer: "Hawaii has the highest average monthly electric bill at $217 in 2026, driven by the nation's highest electricity rate (42.1 cents/kWh). On the mainland, Connecticut ($208), Alabama ($178), and Massachusetts ($177) rank highest. Alabama and Connecticut achieve high bills through completely different mechanisms — Alabama through massive consumption (1,210 kWh/month) and Connecticut through expensive rates (29.9 cents/kWh)."
  },
  {
    question: "What state has the lowest electric bill?",
    answer: "Utah has the lowest average electric bill at $93 per month, combining affordable rates (11.2 cents/kWh) with moderate consumption (832 kWh/month). Wyoming ($97), Colorado ($98), Illinois ($101), and Washington ($102) round out the top five cheapest states for electric bills."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a $200 monthly electric bill normal?",
    answer: "A $200/month electric bill is above the $149 national average but not unusual. It's typical for all-electric homes over 2,000 sq ft, homes in hot Southern states during summer months, or any home in a high-rate state. If you have gas heating and a home under 2,000 sq ft, $200/month is above expectations and worth investigating for efficiency issues, phantom loads, or malfunctioning equipment."
  },
  {
    question: "How much has the average electric bill gone up in recent years?",
    answer: "Average electric bills have increased about 15% from 2020 to 2026, rising from approximately $130/month to $149/month. The largest spike occurred in 2022 when rates jumped over 10% due to natural gas price surges and inflation. Since then, increases have moderated to 1.5-2.5% annually. The increase reflects higher per-kWh rates partly offset by improving efficiency and declining per-household consumption."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the average electric bill include gas heating costs?",
    answer: "No, average electric bill figures include only electricity charges. Homes with natural gas heating have a separate gas bill averaging $60-$100/month nationally. All-electric homes show higher electric bills but zero gas bills. When comparing total energy costs between homes, you need to add electric and gas bills together. An all-electric home with a $200/month electric bill may have lower total energy costs than a gas-heated home with a $130 electric bill plus $90 gas bill."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a normal electric bill for a 1-bedroom apartment?",
    answer: "A 1-bedroom apartment typically has an electric bill of $50-$100/month, depending on location, heating type, and local rates. In large apartment buildings with gas heating, bills can be as low as $30-$50 in mild months. All-electric apartments with baseboard heating in high-rate states may see winter bills of $150-$200. The national average for apartments in buildings with 5 or more units is about $77/month."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I lower my electric bill by $50 per month?",
    answer: "A $50/month reduction is achievable by combining several actions: install a smart thermostat with setback schedules ($15-$30/month savings), switch all remaining bulbs to LED ($12-$20/month), use smart power strips to eliminate phantom loads ($8-$15/month), lower your water heater to 120 degrees F ($4-$8/month), and wash clothes in cold water ($8-$15/month). Total investment: $200-$500 with payback in 4-10 months."
  },
  {
    question: "What uses the most electricity and drives up my bill?",
    answer: "Air conditioning is the single largest electricity consumer in most US homes, accounting for 16% of annual use but up to 40-50% during peak summer months. In all-electric homes, heating can be even larger. Water heating ranks second at 14%. Other major consumers include clothes dryers (4%), refrigerators (7%), and lighting (10%). HVAC combined represents about 45% of total electricity use — making it the clear priority for bill reduction."
  },
  {
    question: "Are electric bills higher in summer or winter?",
    answer: "It depends on your region and heating fuel. Nationally, summer bills are slightly higher (August average: $180) than winter (January average: $172). In the South and Southwest, summer bills can be 50-70% higher than winter due to intense AC loads. In northern states with electric heating, winter bills exceed summer by 30-50%. Homes with gas heating see their highest electric bills in summer and lowest in winter, while their gas bills follow the opposite pattern."
