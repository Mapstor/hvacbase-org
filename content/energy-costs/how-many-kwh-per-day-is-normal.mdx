The average US household uses **29.1 kWh per day**, which works out to 886 kWh per month or 10,632 kWh per year according to EIA data. But "normal" varies wildly — from 17 kWh/day in Hawaii to 41 kWh/day in Louisiana — depending on your state, home size, heating fuel, and the number of people in your household.

If you're trying to figure out whether your electricity usage is high, low, or right on target, this guide gives you the benchmarks you need. We'll break it down by every factor that matters so you can make an apples-to-apples comparison.

<TableOfContents />

## US Average kWh Per Day: The Quick Answer

| Time Period | Average Usage |
|---|---|
| Per Hour | 1.21 kWh |
| Per Day | 29.1 kWh |
| Per Week | 204 kWh |
| Per Month | 886 kWh |
| Per Year | 10,632 kWh |

These numbers represent the national average across all states, home types, and fuel mixes. Your individual usage could easily be 50% below or 100% above these figures depending on your specific circumstances.

<Callout type="info">
**Quick check:** Divide your monthly electric bill's kWh total by 30 to get your daily average. If you use less than 20 kWh/day, you're well below average. If you use 20–35 kWh/day, you're in the typical range. Above 40 kWh/day means you're a high-consumption household — but that's not necessarily a problem if you have a large home or all-electric heating.

## Average kWh Per Day by State (2026)

State-level differences are enormous because climate, prevalent heating fuel, home sizes, and electricity rates all vary. Here's the complete picture.

### States With the Highest Daily Electricity Usage

| Rank | State | kWh/Day | kWh/Month | Primary Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Louisiana | 41.1 | 1,252 | Hot, humid + electric heating |
| 2 | Tennessee | 40.0 | 1,218 | All-electric homes common |
| 3 | Mississippi | 39.9 | 1,214 | Extreme heat + poverty |
| 4 | Alabama | 39.7 | 1,210 | Heavy AC + electric heat |
| 5 | South Carolina | 37.7 | 1,148 | Long cooling season |
| 6 | Georgia | 37.2 | 1,132 | Large homes + heat/humidity |
| 7 | North Carolina | 36.3 | 1,106 | Mixed electric/gas heating |
| 8 | Texas | 35.8 | 1,090 | Extreme summer heat |
| 9 | Oklahoma | 35.5 | 1,081 | Hot summers + electric heat |
| 10 | Arkansas | 35.2 | 1,072 | Climate + all-electric homes |

The Southeast dominates this list for two reasons: long, brutal cooling seasons requiring heavy AC use, and a high prevalence of all-electric homes using electric resistance heating or heat pumps (as opposed to gas furnaces in the Midwest and Northeast).

### States With the Lowest Daily Electricity Usage

| Rank | State | kWh/Day | kWh/Month | Primary Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hawaii | 16.9 | 515 | Mild climate + high rates suppress use |
| 2 | Maine | 17.6 | 536 | Gas/oil heating, mild summers |
| 3 | Vermont | 17.8 | 542 | Gas/oil heat, mild summers |
| 4 | California | 18.1 | 550 | Mild climate + high rates + efficiency standards |
| 5 | New Hampshire | 20.1 | 612 | Oil/gas heating common |
| 6 | Massachusetts | 20.3 | 618 | Gas heat, cool summers |
| 7 | New York | 20.5 | 624 | Gas heat, apartments |
| 8 | Rhode Island | 19.0 | 580 | Gas heat, small state |
| 9 | Connecticut | 22.9 | 697 | Gas/oil heat |
| 10 | Colorado | 22.9 | 698 | Gas heat, dry climate |

Low-usage states fall into two categories: states with mild climates (Hawaii, California) and states where homes heat primarily with natural gas or oil rather than electricity (New England, New York).

## Average kWh Per Day by Home Size

Bigger homes use more electricity. That's obvious, but the relationship isn't perfectly linear — larger homes tend to have more efficient HVAC systems and better insulation per square foot.

| Home Size (sq ft) | Avg kWh/Day | Avg kWh/Month | Avg kWh/Year |
|---|---|---|---|
| Under 1,000 | 16.4 | 500 | 6,000 |
| 1,000–1,499 | 22.3 | 679 | 8,148 |
| 1,500–1,999 | 27.6 | 840 | 10,080 |
| 2,000–2,499 | 31.8 | 968 | 11,616 |
| 2,500–2,999 | 36.2 | 1,102 | 13,224 |
| 3,000–3,999 | 42.1 | 1,281 | 15,372 |
| 4,000+ | 52.7 | 1,604 | 19,248 |

<Callout type="tip">
A good efficiency benchmark is **10–15 kWh per 1,000 sq ft per day**. If your home uses more than 20 kWh per 1,000 sq ft per day, you likely have efficiency issues worth investigating — poor insulation, old HVAC equipment, or energy-wasting appliances. Try our [DIY energy audit guide](/home-energy-audit-diy) to find the culprits.

## Average kWh Per Day by Household Size

The number of people in your home affects electricity use through hot water consumption, appliance use, lighting, and electronics.

| Household Size | Avg kWh/Day | Avg kWh/Month | Compared to Average |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 person | 21.0 | 639 | -28% |
| 2 people | 27.3 | 831 | -6% |
| 3 people | 31.5 | 959 | +8% |
| 4 people | 34.8 | 1,060 | +20% |
| 5+ people | 39.2 | 1,193 | +35% |

Each additional person adds roughly 4–5 kWh/day, primarily through increased hot water use, laundry loads, cooking, and electronic device charging. However, the per-person consumption drops with household size due to shared heating, cooling, lighting, and refrigeration.

| Household Size | kWh/Person/Day | kWh/Person/Month |
|---|---|---|
| 1 person | 21.0 | 639 |
| 2 people | 13.7 | 416 |
| 3 people | 10.5 | 320 |
| 4 people | 8.7 | 265 |
| 5+ people | 7.0 | 213 |

## Average kWh Per Day by Home Type

| Home Type | Avg kWh/Day | Avg kWh/Month | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single-family detached | 33.1 | 1,008 | Largest, most exposure to weather |
| Single-family attached (townhouse) | 24.3 | 740 | Shared walls reduce heating/cooling |
| Apartment (2–4 units) | 18.8 | 572 | Smaller, shared walls/floors |
| Apartment (5+ units) | 14.8 | 450 | Smallest, most shared surfaces |
| Mobile home | 27.1 | 825 | Often all-electric, poor insulation |

Single-family detached homes use more than double the electricity of large-building apartments. The main drivers are larger square footage, more exterior wall area exposed to weather, and higher prevalence of energy-intensive appliances like clothes dryers, dishwashers, and second refrigerators.

## Average kWh Per Day by Heating Fuel Type

This is one of the biggest differentiators. Homes that heat with electricity use dramatically more kWh than those heating with natural gas.

| Primary Heating Fuel | Avg kWh/Day | Avg kWh/Month | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Electricity (heat pump) | 36.1 | 1,100 | Efficient but all-electric load |
| Electricity (resistance) | 41.3 | 1,258 | Very high electric use |
| Natural Gas | 23.5 | 716 | Heating load on gas bill instead |
| Propane | 22.8 | 694 | Similar to gas homes |
| Fuel Oil | 21.3 | 649 | Low electric, high oil bill |
| No heating | 19.7 | 600 | Mild climates only |

<Callout type="important">
If your home heats with natural gas and you're comparing your electricity usage to national averages, remember that the national average includes millions of all-electric homes. Gas-heated homes averaging 23.5 kWh/day is perfectly normal — you're not being wasteful just because you're below the 29.1 kWh national average. Your total energy picture includes your gas bill too.
</Callout>

## kWh Usage by Season

Electricity consumption varies dramatically through the year, especially in regions with hot summers or where electric heating is common.

### National Average kWh Per Day by Month

| Month | Avg kWh/Day | vs. Annual Average | Primary Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| January | 33.5 | +15% | Electric heating peak |
| February | 32.1 | +10% | Heating |
| March | 28.4 | -2% | Transition |
| April | 24.8 | -15% | Mild weather |
| May | 26.3 | -10% | Early cooling |
| June | 31.2 | +7% | Cooling ramp-up |
| July | 35.8 | +23% | Cooling peak |
| August | 36.4 | +25% | Cooling peak |
| September | 31.0 | +7% | Cooling |
| October | 25.8 | -11% | Transition |
| November | 27.5 | -6% | Early heating |
| December | 31.4 | +8% | Heating + holidays |

Your "baseload" — the minimum daily usage in the mildest months (April, May, October) — represents the electricity used for non-HVAC purposes: refrigeration, lighting, cooking, electronics, water heating, and laundry. For the average home, this baseload is about 24–26 kWh/day.

Everything above the baseload is your weather-driven HVAC consumption. In peak summer or winter months, HVAC can add 10–15 kWh/day to your baseline.

## What's Using All Those kWh? Daily Breakdown

Here's where your daily kilowatt-hours actually go in a typical household:

| Category | Avg kWh/Day | % of Total | Key Appliances |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heating | 5.5* | 19% | Furnace fan, heat pump |
| Cooling | 4.6** | 16% | Central AC, fans |
| Water Heating | 4.1 | 14% | Electric tank heater |
| Refrigeration | 2.0 | 7% | Fridge + freezer |
| Lighting | 2.9 | 10% | All fixtures |
| Electronics | 1.7 | 6% | TVs, computers, phones |
| Laundry | 1.5 | 5% | Washer + dryer |
| Cooking | 1.2 | 4% | Range/oven, microwave |
| Other | 5.6 | 19% | Misc. |
| **Total** | **29.1** | **100%** | |

*Includes all-electric homes; gas-heated homes use ~1.5 kWh/day for the furnace blower. **Averaged over the full year; summer peak is much higher.

## Real-World Examples: How Actual Households Compare

### Example 1: Retired Couple in San Diego, CA

**Home:** 1,600 sq ft condo, gas heating, 2 people, ENERGY STAR appliances. **Usage: 12 kWh/day (365 kWh/month).** This is about 59% below the national average — explainable by the mild climate, gas heating, smaller home, efficient appliances, and only two residents. Perfectly normal for their situation.

### Example 2: Family of Five in Houston, TX

**Home:** 3,200 sq ft house, all-electric heat pump, 5 people, pool pump. **Usage: 58 kWh/day (1,764 kWh/month).** This is 99% above the national average — but when you account for the large home, all-electric heating/cooling in a hot climate, five residents, and a pool pump (adding ~12 kWh/day), their usage is actually quite reasonable.

### Example 3: Single Professional in Chicago, IL

**Home:** 750 sq ft apartment, gas heat, 1 person. **Usage: 11 kWh/day (335 kWh/month).** At 62% below the national average, this is an extremely low-usage household. The gas heating, small apartment, single occupancy, and shared-wall construction all contribute to minimal electricity needs.

### Example 4: Work-From-Home Couple in Portland, OR

**Home:** 2,100 sq ft house, gas furnace, 2 people, home offices with dual monitors. **Usage: 28 kWh/day (852 kWh/month).** Right at the national average despite working from home, which adds about 4–5 kWh/day from computers, monitors, lighting, and extra HVAC runtime. Oregon's mild climate and gas heating offset the increased daytime electricity use.

## How to Check if Your kWh Usage Is Too High

Follow this three-step process to evaluate your electricity consumption:

**Step 1: Calculate your daily average.** Take your most recent monthly kWh total and divide by 30. Compare it to the appropriate benchmark from the tables above based on your state, home size, and heating fuel type.

**Step 2: Calculate your baseload.** Look at your mildest-weather month (usually April or October). That month's daily average represents your non-HVAC baseload. For a gas-heated home, a healthy baseload is 15–22 kWh/day. For an all-electric home, 18–26 kWh/day.

**Step 3: Calculate your HVAC overhead.** Subtract your baseload from your peak summer or winter daily average. If HVAC adds more than 15–20 kWh/day, your equipment may be undersized, poorly maintained, or your home may have insulation or air-sealing deficiencies.

<Callout type="warning">
A sudden increase in daily kWh (more than 20% above your baseline without an obvious cause like a heat wave or new appliance) could indicate a malfunctioning appliance, HVAC issue, or even a utility metering error. Check your [electric meter](/how-to-read-electric-meter) readings manually to verify.
</Callout>

## How to Reduce Your Daily kWh Usage

If your usage is higher than the benchmarks suggest it should be, here are the highest-impact actions:

**For high-baseload homes (non-HVAC usage above 25 kWh/day):**
- Replace old refrigerators (new ENERGY STAR models use 1.1 kWh/day vs. 2.5+ for older units)
- Eliminate phantom loads with smart power strips
- Switch remaining incandescent/CFL bulbs to LED
- Upgrade to a heat pump water heater (saves 8–10 kWh/day vs. standard electric tank)
- Run full dishwasher and laundry loads only

**For high-HVAC-overhead homes (heating/cooling adds 20+ kWh/day above baseload):**
- Get your HVAC system serviced (dirty coils alone can increase consumption 15–20%)
- Seal air leaks and add insulation
- Upgrade to a higher-efficiency system
- Install a smart thermostat with scheduling and occupancy detection
- Use ceiling fans to raise AC setpoint 3–4°F

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Key Takeaways:**
- The US average is 29.1 kWh/day (886 kWh/month)
- State averages range from 17 kWh/day (Hawaii) to 41 kWh/day (Louisiana)
- All-electric homes average 36–41 kWh/day; gas-heated homes average 22–24 kWh/day
- Your daily usage per 1,000 sq ft should be 10–15 kWh — above 20 suggests efficiency issues
- Seasonal variation of ±25% is normal due to HVAC load changes
- Compare your usage to homes with similar size, heating fuel, climate, and household size for a fair benchmark

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How many kWh per day is normal for a 2,000 sq ft house?",
    answer: "A 2,000 sq ft house typically uses 28–35 kWh per day (850–1,060 kWh/month). If heated with gas, expect the lower end (28–30 kWh/day). If all-electric, expect the higher end (32–38 kWh/day). In hot climates like Texas or Florida, summer peaks can push daily usage to 45–55 kWh due to heavy AC loads. In mild climates like the Pacific Northwest, 22–28 kWh/day is common."
  },
  {
    question: "Is 50 kWh per day a lot?",
    answer: "50 kWh per day (1,500 kWh/month) is above the national average of 29.1 kWh/day but not necessarily excessive. It's typical for a large (3,000+ sq ft) all-electric home in a hot or cold climate, or a moderate-sized home with a pool pump, hot tub, or EV charging. If your home is under 2,000 sq ft with gas heating, 50 kWh/day is high and warrants investigation for efficiency issues."
  },
  {
    question: "How many kWh per day does a one-person apartment use?",
    answer: "A single person in an apartment typically uses 10–18 kWh per day (300–540 kWh/month). The national average for single-person households is about 21 kWh/day, but that includes single-family homes. Apartments benefit from shared walls, smaller spaces, and often gas heating, bringing usage well below the overall average. If you're consistently above 20 kWh/day in a small apartment, check for an inefficient water heater or old appliances."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does the Southeast use so much more electricity than the Northeast?",
    answer: "Three factors drive the Southeast's higher electricity usage: (1) Long, hot cooling seasons requiring 6–8 months of AC, while the Northeast has only 2–3 months of moderate cooling. (2) Higher prevalence of all-electric homes — many Southern homes use electric heat pumps or resistance heating instead of gas furnaces. (3) Lower electricity rates encourage higher consumption. The Northeast uses less electricity but more natural gas, oil, and propane for heating."
  },
  {
    question: "Does working from home increase kWh usage?",
    answer: "Yes, working from home typically adds 3–5 kWh per day to your electricity consumption. The main drivers are computer equipment (1–2 kWh/day for a desktop + monitor, less for a laptop), additional lighting (0.5–1 kWh/day), and extended HVAC runtime to maintain comfort during previously unoccupied hours (1–3 kWh/day). Annual impact: roughly 1,100–1,800 additional kWh or $185–$300 at the national average rate."
  },
  {
    question: "How many kWh does an electric car add per day?",
    answer: "An average EV driven 35 miles per day at 3.5 miles/kWh adds about 10 kWh per day to your household electricity consumption — roughly 300 kWh per month. That's a 34% increase above the national average daily usage. At the national average rate, this costs about $1.68/day or $50/month. Charging on off-peak TOU rates can reduce this to $25–$35/month."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between kW and kWh?",
    answer: "A kilowatt (kW) measures power — the rate of energy use at any instant. A kilowatt-hour (kWh) measures energy — total consumption over time. Think of kW as the speed of a car and kWh as the distance traveled. A 3 kW air conditioner (power) running for 4 hours uses 12 kWh (energy). Your utility charges you for kWh consumed, not kW drawn (though some commercial plans include demand charges based on peak kW)."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find my kWh usage without looking at my bill?",
    answer: "You can read your electric meter directly — most modern digital meters display current kWh readings. Take a reading at the same time on consecutive days to get your daily usage. You can also log into your utility's online portal, which typically shows daily or hourly usage data if you have a smart meter. Whole-home energy monitors like Emporia Vue or Sense provide real-time kWh tracking via a smartphone app."
  },
  {
    question: "Is 30 kWh per day good or bad?",
    answer: "30 kWh per day is almost exactly the national average (29.1 kWh/day), so it's statistically 'normal.' Whether it's good depends on your circumstances. For a 3,000 sq ft all-electric home, 30 kWh/day would be impressively efficient. For a 1,200 sq ft gas-heated apartment, it would be quite high. The right benchmark depends on your home size, heating fuel type, household size, and climate zone."
  },
  {
    question: "How many kWh per day does air conditioning use?",
    answer: "Central air conditioning in a typical 2,000 sq ft home uses 10–28 kWh per day during cooling season, depending on climate severity and equipment efficiency. A 14 SEER system in Phoenix might run 20–28 kWh/day in July, while a 20 SEER2 system in Virginia might use 8–14 kWh/day. Window units use 5–12 kWh/day. Averaged over the full year (including months with no cooling), the national average is about 4.6 kWh/day for cooling."
