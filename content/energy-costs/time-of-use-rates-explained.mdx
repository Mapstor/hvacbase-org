Time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates charge you different prices depending on **when** you use electricity — typically 30-50% less during off-peak hours (nights and weekends) and 50-100% more during peak hours (weekday afternoons). If you can shift even a portion of your heavy electricity use to off-peak times, TOU plans can save you **15-25% on your electric bill** without reducing your total consumption.

TOU plans are especially powerful for EV owners, solar panel owners, and households with flexible schedules. They're the fastest-growing rate structure in the US, with many utilities now making TOU the default plan for new customers.

<TableOfContents />

## How Time-of-Use Rates Work

On a flat-rate plan, you pay the same price per kWh whether you use electricity at 3 PM or 3 AM. On a TOU plan, the price varies by time period to reflect the actual cost of generating and delivering electricity throughout the day.

### Why Prices Vary by Time of Day

Electricity demand peaks on weekday afternoons when businesses are running, people come home and crank up the AC, and everyone starts cooking dinner. To meet this peak demand, utilities must fire up expensive "peaker" plants that only run a few hours per day. Off-peak hours (nights, early mornings, weekends) require only efficient baseload generation.

TOU rates pass these real cost differences on to you, rewarding you for using electricity when it's cheapest to produce.

### Typical TOU Rate Structure

| Period | Typical Hours | Rate vs. Flat Rate | Example Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Off-Peak | 9 PM - 7 AM + weekends | 30-50% lower | $0.08-$0.12/kWh |
| Mid-Peak (if applicable) | 7 AM - 2 PM, 7 PM - 9 PM | Similar to flat rate | $0.14-$0.18/kWh |
| On-Peak | 2 PM - 7 PM weekdays | 50-100% higher | $0.25-$0.50/kWh |
| Super Off-Peak (if available) | 12 AM - 6 AM | 50-70% lower | $0.05-$0.08/kWh |

<Callout type="warning">
Peak hours and rate structures vary significantly by utility. **Always check your specific utility's TOU schedule** before making decisions. Some utilities define peak as 1 PM - 9 PM, others as 4 PM - 9 PM. Some have two peak periods (morning and evening). Seasonal changes are common too — summer peak hours may be longer than winter.

### TOU Rate Examples From Major Utilities (2026)

| Utility | Off-Peak Rate | On-Peak Rate | Peak Hours | Peak/Off-Peak Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SCE (Southern CA) | $0.14/kWh | $0.47/kWh | 4-9 PM weekdays | 3.4x |
| PG&E (Northern CA) | $0.13/kWh | $0.49/kWh | 4-9 PM weekdays | 3.8x |
| APS (Arizona) | $0.08/kWh | $0.24/kWh | 3-8 PM weekdays | 3.0x |
| ComEd (Illinois) | $0.03/kWh | $0.12/kWh | 2-7 PM weekdays (summer) | 4.0x |
| Duke Energy (NC) | $0.09/kWh | $0.22/kWh | 1-6 PM weekdays (summer) | 2.4x |
| Georgia Power | $0.06/kWh | $0.20/kWh | 2-7 PM weekdays (summer) | 3.3x |

## Who Saves the Most on TOU Plans

TOU plans don't save everyone money. Your savings depend on how much electricity you can shift away from peak hours.

### Best Candidates for TOU Plans

| Profile | Why TOU Works | Expected Savings |
|---|---|---|
| EV owners | Can schedule charging overnight | 20-40% on EV costs |
| Solar panel owners | Export during peak, use grid off-peak | 15-30% overall |
| Work-from-home | Flexible schedule for laundry, cooking | 10-20% |
| Night shift workers | Naturally heavy off-peak usage | 15-25% |
| Pool owners | Schedule pump for off-peak hours | 25-40% on pool costs |
| Battery storage owners | Charge batteries off-peak, use during peak | 20-35% |
| Retirees with flexibility | Can shift most discretionary loads | 15-25% |

### Worst Candidates for TOU Plans

| Profile | Why TOU May Not Work | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Large families home all day | High peak-hour consumption from cooking, AC, electronics | Could pay MORE |
| Home daycare providers | Must run HVAC and appliances during peak | Higher bills |
| People who can't shift loads | Fixed schedules, medical equipment | No savings |
| Very small electric bills | Savings too small to matter | Not worth the effort |

<Callout type="tip">
Before switching to a TOU plan, **request a shadow bill** from your utility. Many utilities will calculate what your last 12 months of bills would have been under TOU rates so you can see whether you'd save before committing.

## How to Maximize TOU Savings

### The Big Loads to Shift

Focus on shifting your heaviest electricity consumers to off-peak hours. Small loads (phone charging, LED lights) make negligible difference.

| Load | kWh per Use | Peak Cost | Off-Peak Cost | Savings per Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EV charging (full charge) | 40-60 kWh | $12-$29 | $3-$7 | $5-$22 |
| Clothes dryer (1 load) | 3-5 kWh | $0.90-$2.45 | $0.24-$0.60 | $0.30-$1.85 |
| Dishwasher (1 cycle) | 1.8 kWh | $0.54-$0.88 | $0.14-$0.22 | $0.32-$0.66 |
| Clothes washer (hot water) | 2-3 kWh | $0.60-$1.47 | $0.16-$0.36 | $0.24-$1.11 |
| Pool pump (8 hours) | 12 kWh | $3.60-$5.88 | $0.96-$1.44 | $2.16-$4.44 |
| Electric water heater | 4-6 kWh/day | $1.20-$2.94 | $0.32-$0.72 | $0.48-$2.22 |
| Pre-cool/pre-heat home | 5-10 kWh | Avoided at peak | $0.40-$1.20 | Eliminates peak AC |

### Strategy 1: Program Your EV to Charge Off-Peak

If you drive an EV and charge at home, this single change can save $100-$250/month compared to peak charging. Every major EV and most Level 2 chargers support scheduled charging. Set it to start after your off-peak period begins (typically 9 PM) and finish before it ends (typically 7 AM).

### Strategy 2: Use Timers on Major Appliances

Set your dishwasher's delay start to run at 9 PM or later. Do laundry in the evening or on weekends. If your water heater has a timer or smart controller, heat water during off-peak hours (the tank stores hot water for use during peak).

### Strategy 3: Pre-Cool Your Home Before Peak

During summer, cool your home to 72-73 degrees F before the peak period starts (e.g., by 2 PM). Then raise the thermostat to 77-78 degrees F during peak hours. The thermal mass of your home maintains reasonable comfort for 3-5 hours while your AC runs minimally during the most expensive period.

Many smart thermostats (Ecobee, Nest, Honeywell) have TOU-aware features that automate this pre-cooling strategy.

### Strategy 4: Battery Storage Arbitrage

If you have a home battery (Tesla Powerwall, Enphase IQ, etc.), charge it during off-peak hours at $0.08-$0.12/kWh, then discharge during peak hours instead of buying grid electricity at $0.25-$0.50/kWh. The spread can be $0.15-$0.40/kWh, yielding $100-$300/month in savings for heavy users.

### Strategy 5: Solar + TOU Optimization

Solar panels produce maximum output during midday hours. Under TOU rates, export your excess solar during peak hours (when you receive the highest credit) and consume grid power during cheap off-peak hours. This maximizes the financial value of every kWh your panels produce.

## Calculating Your TOU Savings

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Step 1:** Get your hourly usage data from your utility portal (smart meter required).

**Step 2:** Categorize each hour as on-peak, mid-peak, or off-peak according to your utility's TOU schedule.

**Step 3:** Calculate what you'd pay under TOU vs. flat rate.

### Example Calculation

A household using 900 kWh/month in Southern California:

| Time Period | Hours/Month | kWh Used | Flat Rate Cost | TOU Rate | TOU Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Off-Peak (9 PM - 4 PM) | 570 | 540 | $97.20 | $0.14 | $75.60 |
| On-Peak (4 PM - 9 PM) | 150 | 280 | $50.40 | $0.47 | $131.60 |
| Weekends (all day) | Included above | 80 | $14.40 | $0.14 | $11.20 |
| **Total** | | **900** | **$162.00** | | **$218.40** |

Without any load shifting, this household would actually pay **MORE** on TOU. But if they shift 150 kWh from peak to off-peak (EV charging, laundry, dishwasher, pool pump):

| Period | kWh | TOU Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Off-Peak | 690 | $96.60 |
| On-Peak | 130 | $61.10 |
| Weekends | 80 | $11.20 |
| **Total** | **900** | **$168.90** |

After load shifting: $168.90 vs. $162.00 flat — still slightly more. This household needs aggressive pre-cooling and more load shifting to benefit. The math changes dramatically with solar panels, where peak exports earn high credits.

<Callout type="important">
TOU plans are not automatically cheaper. You must actively shift loads to benefit. If you can't shift at least 30-40% of your peak consumption to off-peak hours, a flat rate may be better. Always request a shadow bill analysis before switching.

## Real-World TOU Savings Examples

### Example 1: EV Owner in Arizona

**Profile:** 2,200 sq ft home, 1,100 kWh/month, Tesla Model Y driven 1,200 miles/month. **Flat rate:** $0.142/kWh ($156/month). **TOU plan:** Off-peak $0.08/kWh, On-peak $0.24/kWh.

EV charging shifted to midnight (off-peak): 343 kWh x $0.08 = $27.44 (was $48.71). Other loads partially shifted. **Monthly TOU bill: $122.** Savings: **$34/month ($408/year).**

### Example 2: Solar + Battery Home in California

**Profile:** 6 kW solar array, 13.5 kWh Tesla Powerwall, SCE TOU plan. Solar produces 800 kWh/month. Home uses 750 kWh/month.

Solar exports during peak (4-9 PM): 200 kWh x $0.47 credit = $94 credit. Battery covers evening peak demand. Off-peak grid use: 150 kWh x $0.14 = $21. **Monthly bill: -$73 (net credit).** Without TOU: flat rate would yield only $26 net credit. TOU advantage: **$47/month ($564/year).**

### Example 3: Retired Couple in North Carolina

**Profile:** 1,800 sq ft home, 850 kWh/month, flexible schedule. Duke Energy TOU plan.

Shifted laundry, dishwasher, and cooking to off-peak. Pre-cool home before summer peak. **Monthly savings: $18-$28/month ($216-$336/year).** Minimal lifestyle disruption — just timing changes.

### Example 4: Family That Lost Money on TOU

**Profile:** Family of five, 1,400 kWh/month, both parents work from home, kids home from school by 3 PM. Heavy peak-hour usage from cooking, homework electronics, and AC.

Unable to significantly shift loads from the 2-7 PM peak window. After 3 months on TOU, bills were $25-$40/month higher. Switched back to flat rate. **Lesson: TOU plans require load flexibility.**

## TOU Plans and Smart Home Automation

Smart home technology makes TOU optimization nearly effortless:

| Device | TOU Feature | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Smart Thermostat (Ecobee, Nest) | Auto pre-cool/pre-heat before peak | $130-$250 |
| EV Charger (ChargePoint, Wallbox) | Scheduled off-peak charging | $400-$700 |
| Smart Plug / Smart Power Strip | Schedule devices for off-peak | $15-$40 |
| Smart Water Heater Controller | Heat water during off-peak only | $100-$200 |
| Home Battery (Powerwall, IQ) | Automated peak shaving | $8,000-$15,000 |
| Smart Pool Pump Timer | Schedule for off-peak | $50-$200 |

A smart thermostat alone typically captures 40-60% of the TOU savings available to a household.

## How to Switch to a TOU Plan

**Step 1:** Check if your utility offers TOU plans. Visit your utility's website or call customer service. Most large utilities in CA, AZ, IL, GA, NC, TX, and other states offer at least one TOU option.

**Step 2:** Request a shadow bill analysis. Ask the utility to calculate what your last 12 months of bills would have been on TOU vs. your current plan.

**Step 3:** Review the peak/off-peak schedule carefully. Make sure peak hours don't align with your heaviest, non-shiftable usage.

**Step 4:** Set up automation. Program your thermostat, EV charger, and major appliances for off-peak operation before switching.

**Step 5:** Switch and monitor. Most utilities allow you to switch back to a flat rate if TOU doesn't work for you (sometimes with a waiting period).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "What are time-of-use electricity rates?",
    answer: "Time-of-use (TOU) rates are electricity pricing plans where the cost per kWh varies by time of day, day of week, and sometimes season. Off-peak hours (typically nights and weekends) are cheapest — often 30-50% below flat rates. On-peak hours (typically weekday afternoons, 2-7 PM) are most expensive — 50-100% above flat rates. The goal is to incentivize shifting electricity use to times when demand on the grid is lowest."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save on a time-of-use plan?",
    answer: "Savings range from 0% to 35% depending on how much load you can shift. A household that shifts EV charging, laundry, dishwashing, and pool pumping to off-peak saves 15-25%. Solar panel owners with TOU can save 20-30% by maximizing peak-hour exports. However, households that cannot shift much peak usage may actually pay more on TOU. Request a shadow bill from your utility to see your projected savings before switching."
  },
  {
    question: "What are peak hours for electricity?",
    answer: "Peak hours vary by utility but are typically weekday afternoons when electricity demand is highest. Common peak periods include 2-7 PM, 3-8 PM, or 4-9 PM. Summer peak hours are often longer than winter. Weekends and federal holidays are usually off-peak all day. Check your specific utility's TOU schedule — even utilities in the same state may define peak hours differently."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a TOU plan worth it with solar panels?",
    answer: "TOU plans are often excellent for solar panel owners. Your panels produce maximum power during midday and early afternoon. Under TOU with net metering, energy exported during peak hours earns the highest per-kWh credit. Then you draw cheap off-peak power at night. This buy-low-sell-high dynamic maximizes the financial value of solar. With a battery, you can further optimize by storing solar energy and discharging during peak."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch back to a flat rate if TOU doesn't work?",
    answer: "Most utilities allow you to switch back, but policies vary. Some require staying on a plan for a minimum period (3-12 months) before switching. Some allow one switch per year. Others let you switch anytime. Check your utility's policy before enrolling. Many utilities also offer a trial period or will run a shadow bill analysis to show whether TOU would save you money."
  },
  {
    question: "Does running the dishwasher at night really save money?",
    answer: "Only if you're on a TOU rate plan. On a flat-rate plan, electricity costs the same regardless of when you use it. On TOU, running the dishwasher at 9 PM instead of 6 PM can save $0.30-$0.70 per cycle — about $10-$20 per month if you run it daily. The savings come from the rate difference between peak and off-peak, not from reduced consumption."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know my peak hours?",
    answer: "Your peak hours are defined by your utility and specific rate plan. Find them by logging into your utility's online portal, checking your bill statement (which should show the rate schedule name), or calling customer service. Peak hours typically shift seasonally — summer peaks are often longer (driven by AC demand) while winter peaks may be shorter or shifted earlier (driven by heating and lighting demand)."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best smart thermostat for TOU rates?",
    answer: "The Ecobee Premium and Google Nest Learning Thermostat both support TOU-aware scheduling. Ecobee's 'Time of Use' feature automatically pre-cools your home before peak and raises the setpoint during peak hours. Nest's 'Rush Hour Rewards' works similarly. Both cost $130-$250 and typically capture 40-60% of available TOU HVAC savings. Make sure the thermostat you choose supports your utility's specific demand response program if available."
  },
  {
    question: "Are TOU rates good for electric vehicle owners?",
    answer: "TOU plans are one of the best deals available for EV owners. Charging a typical EV uses 300-400 kWh/month. At peak TOU rates ($0.25-$0.50/kWh), this costs $75-$200. At off-peak rates ($0.05-$0.12/kWh), the same charging costs $15-$48 — a savings of $50-$150/month just from timing your charge. Every modern EV and most Level 2 chargers support scheduled charging, making this completely automatic."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between TOU and tiered rates?",
    answer: "Tiered rates charge more per kWh as your total monthly consumption increases (e.g., first 500 kWh at 10 cents, next 500 kWh at 15 cents). The price depends on HOW MUCH you use. TOU rates charge different amounts based on WHEN you use electricity, regardless of total volume. Some utilities combine both — tiered TOU plans where prices vary by both time of day and consumption level. TOU rewards shifting; tiered rewards reducing."
