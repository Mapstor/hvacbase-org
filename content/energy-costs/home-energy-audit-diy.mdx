A thorough DIY energy audit takes about 2-3 hours and can identify **$200-$800 per year** in wasted energy — sometimes more in older homes. You don't need expensive equipment or professional training. A flashlight, a stick of incense, and a systematic room-by-room approach will reveal the biggest energy drains in your home.

Professional energy audits cost $200-$500 and use specialized tools like blower doors and thermal cameras. They're worth it for complex homes, but this DIY audit covers 80% of what a pro would find and costs nothing but your time.

<TableOfContents />

## What You'll Need

| Item | Purpose | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Flashlight | Inspect dark areas (attic, crawlspace) | Already own |
| Incense stick or tissue paper | Detect air leaks | $1-$3 |
| Notepad or phone | Document findings | Already own |
| Infrared thermometer (optional) | Check surface temperatures | $15-$30 |
| Plug-in energy meter (optional) | Measure appliance power draw | $20-$30 |
| Step ladder | Access attic hatch | Already own |
| Last 12 months of utility bills | Establish baseline | Free (utility portal) |

<Callout type="tip">
The best time to perform a DIY energy audit is on a **cold, windy day** (winter) or a hot day (summer). Temperature differences make air leaks much easier to detect.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Analyze Your Utility Bills (15 Minutes)

**Pull 12 months of bills** from your utility portal. Identify your lowest-usage month (baseload) and peak months.

**Calculate your baseload.** Your mildest month (April or October) represents non-HVAC consumption: refrigeration, lighting, water heating, electronics.

**Calculate HVAC overhead.** Subtract baseload from peak months. This tells you exactly what heating and cooling costs.

### Red Flags in Your Bills

| Red Flag | Indicates | Potential Savings |
|---|---|---|
| Baseload over 30 kWh/day (gas-heated) | Phantom loads, old appliances, water heater issues | $100-$300/year |
| Cooling overhead over 20 kWh/day | Inefficient AC, duct leaks, poor insulation | $150-$400/year |
| Year-over-year increase over 15% | Declining equipment efficiency | Varies |
| Sudden spike in one month | Equipment malfunction or meter error | $50-$200+/month |

## Step 2: Exterior Walk-Around (20 Minutes)

Walk the entire perimeter looking for:

**Foundation cracks.** Even hairline cracks allow air infiltration. Seal with hydraulic cement or polyurethane caulk ($20-$60/year savings).

**Utility penetration gaps.** Every pipe, wire, cable, and vent through exterior walls leaks air. Seal with caulk or spray foam ($10-$40/year total).

**Window and door caulking.** Failed exterior caulk lets air and water in. Recaulking costs $20-$50 and saves $30-$80/year.

**Door weatherstripping.** Close each door and look for daylight around edges. Visible light means air is leaking. Replacement costs $5-$15 per door, saves $10-$30/year each.

## Step 3: Attic Inspection (30 Minutes)

The attic is the number one area where energy escapes. This step alone can identify $200-$500/year in savings.

<Callout type="warning">
**Safety first:** Walk only on joists or boards across them. Never step on drywall between joists. Wear a dust mask and gloves with fiberglass insulation. Watch for electrical wiring.
</Callout>

### Insulation Depth Check

Measure with a ruler and compare to recommended R-values:

| Climate Zone | Example States | Recommended R-Value | Fiberglass Depth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zone 1-2 | HI, South FL, TX, AZ | R-38 to R-60 | 12-20 inches |
| Zone 3 | NC, TN, AR, NM | R-38 to R-60 | 12-20 inches |
| Zone 4-5 | VA, MO, OH, PA, CO | R-49 to R-60 | 16-20 inches |
| Zone 6-7 | MN, WI, ME, MT | R-49 to R-60 | 16-20 inches |

Under 10 inches means you're under-insulated. Adding blown-in to R-49 costs $1,500-$2,500 and saves $200-$500/year.

### Attic Air Leak Hot Spots

| Location | How to Seal | Savings |
|---|---|---|
| Attic hatch | Weatherstrip and insulate the door | $30-$70/year |
| Plumbing penetrations | Spray foam around pipes | $10-$30/year |
| Electrical penetrations | Fire-rated caulk | $10-$25/year |
| Recessed lights | IC-rated covers + spray foam | $15-$40/year |
| HVAC duct boots | Mastic sealant | $15-$35/year |
| Chimney chase | Sheet metal + fire-rated caulk (not spray foam) | $20-$50/year |
| Dropped soffits | Rigid foam + canned foam | $15-$40/year |

## Step 4: Interior Walkthrough (45 Minutes)

### Air Leak Detection

Light an incense stick and slowly move it along window frames, door frames, electrical outlets on exterior walls, baseboards, and ceiling/wall joints. Smoke flickering sideways indicates a leak. Mark each with painter's tape.

### HVAC System Check

**Filter:** Pull it out. Dirty and clogged filters increase energy use 5-15%. Replace immediately and check monthly.

**Thermostat:** Is it programmed? Proper setback schedules save 10% annually. A smart thermostat ($130-$250) pays for itself in 1-2 years.

**Registers:** Walk every room. Confirm supply registers are open and unblocked. Return grilles should be clear. Hold tissue near registers to verify airflow.

**Ductwork (accessible areas):** Look for disconnected sections, visible gaps, missing insulation on ducts in unconditioned spaces, and kinked flex duct. Sealing with mastic costs $10-$25 and saves $100-$300/year.

### Water Heater

| Check | Action | Savings |
|---|---|---|
| Temp above 120F | Lower to 120F | $50-$95/year |
| Over 10 years old | Plan replacement (consider heat pump) | Varies |
| Warm to touch | Add insulation blanket ($25) | $20-$45/year |
| Uninsulated hot pipes | Add foam insulation ($15) | $15-$30/year |
| Popping/rumbling sounds | Flush sediment (free) | Restores efficiency |

### Lighting Audit

Count incandescent, CFL, and LED bulbs. Each incandescent-to-LED swap saves $7-$10/year. A 30-fixture whole-home retrofit saves $200-$300/year for $60-$150.

### Phantom Load Hunt

| Device | Standby Power | Annual Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Cable/Satellite Box | 15-30W | $22-$44 |
| Gaming Console (older) | 10-25W | $15-$37 |
| Desktop Computer (sleep) | 5-15W | $7-$22 |
| Printer | 5-10W | $7-$15 |
| Microwave display | 3-5W | $4-$7 |
| Phone Charger (empty) | 0.5-2W | $0.75-$3 |

Total phantom load: 40-80W constant, costing $60-$120/year. Smart power strips ($25-$40 each) eliminate most of this.

## Step 5: Basement and Crawlspace (20 Minutes)

**Rim joist:** Seal with rigid foam and spray foam ($100-$300, saves $50-$150/year). This is one of the biggest leak areas.

**Foundation walls:** Uninsulated basement walls lose significant heat. Rigid foam (R-10 to R-15) costs $500-$2,000 DIY, saves $100-$300/year.

**Crawlspace vapor barrier:** A 6-mil poly barrier ($50-$150) prevents ground moisture from degrading insulation.

**Floor insulation:** Ensure it's intact and supported. Fallen insulation provides zero benefit.

## Step 6: Create Your Priority Action Plan

| Priority | Action | Cost | Annual Savings | Payback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Change filter, program thermostat | $10-$20 | $80-$150 | Immediate |
| 2 | Lower water heater to 120F | $0 | $50-$95 | Immediate |
| 3 | Seal major air leaks | $30-$100 | $100-$300 | 1-4 months |
| 4 | Install smart power strips | $50-$100 | $60-$120 | 5-10 months |
| 5 | LED retrofit | $60-$150 | $150-$250 | 3-7 months |
| 6 | Insulate water heater + pipes | $30-$50 | $35-$75 | 5-9 months |
| 7 | Seal accessible ductwork | $25-$100 | $100-$300 | 1-4 months |
| 8 | Add attic insulation | $1,500-$2,500 | $200-$500 | 3-5 years |
| 9 | Heat pump water heater | $1,800-$3,500 | $300-$450 | 4-8 years |
| 10 | High-efficiency HVAC | $5,000-$12,000 | $300-$800 | 6-12 years |

## Understanding Your Home's Energy Performance Score

After completing your audit, you can benchmark your home's overall efficiency.

### Energy Use Intensity (EUI) Benchmark

Energy Use Intensity measures kBTU per square foot per year. Calculate yours by converting your total annual energy use (electric + gas) to kBTU and dividing by your home's square footage.

| EUI Range (kBTU/sq ft/year) | Rating | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Under 30 | Excellent | Top 10% efficiency, minimal improvements needed |
| 30-50 | Good | Above average, some improvement opportunities |
| 50-75 | Average | Typical US home, significant savings available |
| 75-100 | Below average | Multiple efficiency issues, 25-40% savings potential |
| Over 100 | Poor | Major upgrades needed, 40-60% savings potential |

To calculate: Add your annual electric kWh x 3.412 (converts to kBTU) plus annual gas therms x 100 (converts to kBTU). Divide the total by your home's square footage.

**Example:** 10,000 kWh electric + 600 therms gas = 34,120 + 60,000 = 94,120 kBTU. For a 2,000 sq ft home: 94,120 / 2,000 = **47.1 kBTU/sq ft/year** — Good range.

You can also use ENERGY STAR's Home Energy Yardstick tool (free online) to compare your home to similar homes in your area. It provides a 1-10 score based on your utility data.

## When to Call a Professional

A professional audit ($200-$500) adds value when:
- Bills are significantly above benchmarks with no obvious cause
- Home was built before 1980 and never audited
- You suspect major duct leakage (rooms that won't heat/cool)
- You want blower door testing and thermal imaging
- You're planning major renovations
- Your utility offers free or subsidized audits

The 30% federal tax credit covers up to $150 of a professional audit cost.
