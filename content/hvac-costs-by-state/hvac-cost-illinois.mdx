# HVAC Cost in Illinois: AC, Furnace & Heat Pump Pricing for 2026

**A new HVAC system in Illinois costs between $7,100 and $14,200 in 2026, with the average homeowner paying about $9,600 for a complete AC and furnace replacement.** That's roughly 16% above the national average — driven primarily by the Chicago metro area's higher labor rates and permit costs. Downstate Illinois is actually quite affordable, often matching or beating national averages.

Illinois is a true four-season HVAC state. You need a robust furnace for winters that regularly hit single digits and below zero, and a properly sized AC for summers that push into the 90s with high humidity. This guide breaks down costs for every region and equipment type so you can budget accurately.

## The Chicago vs. Downstate Price Gap

The single most important factor in Illinois HVAC pricing is whether you're in the Chicago metro area or downstate. The difference is dramatic:

<ComparisonTable

    ["Average Install Timeline", "1–3 weeks wait", "3–7 days wait", "Longer waits in Chicago"]
  ]}
/>

### Why Chicago Is More Expensive

**City of Chicago permits and inspections** are the primary cost escalator. Chicago requires a mechanical permit for all HVAC work, a plan review for new installations (not always required for replacements), and an inspection. The permit process in Chicago can take 1–3 weeks.

**Union influence.** While HVAC work in private homes doesn't require union labor, the strong union presence in the Chicago construction market pushes all wages upward. Non-union contractors in Chicago still pay more than their downstate counterparts to attract and retain qualified technicians.

**Cost of living.** Chicago-area overhead — rent, insurance, vehicle costs, fuel — is significantly higher. Contractors pass these costs through to customers.

**Older housing stock.** Chicago has a large inventory of pre-1950 homes with challenging HVAC access. Basements are cramped, ductwork routes are complicated, and older homes often need additional work (electrical upgrades, duct modifications) beyond basic equipment replacement.

## HVAC Costs by Illinois Region

### City of Chicago

**Climate:** Cold winters (avg. 22°F January, with windchill frequently below 0°F), warm humid summers (avg. 84°F July with 65%+ humidity).

**Typical system:** 80,000–100,000 BTU gas furnace + 2.5–3.5 ton AC

**Average full system cost:** $11,000–$15,500

Chicago's HVAC market is large and competitive, with hundreds of contractors. However, the regulatory environment, older building stock, and premium labor rates keep costs well above state and national averages.

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Lincoln Park, Chicago — 1,800 sq ft vintage two-flat (owner's unit).** Replacing a 25-year-old 80,000 BTU furnace and adding a 2.5-ton central AC to existing ductwork. Carrier 16 SEER2 AC + 96% two-stage furnace. Equipment: $5,200. Labor: $4,200. Materials and fittings: $800. Chicago permit: $450. Duct modifications: $1,200. **Total: $11,850.**
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Beverly neighborhood, Chicago — 2,200 sq ft bungalow.** Full HVAC replacement: 3.5-ton Trane 17 SEER2 AC + 100,000 BTU 96% variable-speed furnace. Equipment: $6,200. Labor: $4,600. Materials: $750. Permits: $500. Duct cleaning and sealing: $800. **Total: $12,850.**
</Callout>

### Chicago Suburbs (Cook, DuPage, Lake, Will, Kane Counties)

**Climate:** Same as Chicago, slightly colder in far western and northern suburbs.

**Typical system:** 80,000–100,000 BTU gas furnace + 3–4 ton AC

**Average full system cost:** $9,500–$14,000

Suburban Chicago pricing is slightly lower than the city proper. Permit processes are simpler, access is easier, and there's strong contractor competition. The far western suburbs (Kane, Kendall counties) tend to be the most affordable, while the North Shore (Winnetka, Glencoe, Lake Forest) commands premium pricing due to an affluent customer base expecting top-tier service.

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Naperville, IL — 2,400 sq ft two-story.** Replacing a 17-year-old system with a Lennox 18 SEER2 AC + 96% modulating furnace. Equipment: $7,000. Labor: $3,400. Materials: $700. Permits: $300. **Total: $11,400.**
</Callout>

### Springfield / Central Illinois

**Climate:** True four-season. Cold winters (avg. 25°F January), hot humid summers (avg. 87°F July).

**Typical system:** 80,000 BTU gas furnace + 3-ton AC

**Average full system cost:** $7,500–$11,000

Central Illinois offers pricing close to the national average. Moderate labor rates, reasonable permits, and good contractor competition keep costs in check.

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Springfield, IL — 2,000 sq ft ranch.** Standard replacement with Rheem 16 SEER2 AC + 80,000 BTU 96% furnace. Equipment: $4,400. Labor: $2,200. Materials: $500. Permits: $150. **Total: $7,250.**
</Callout>

### Southern Illinois (Carbondale, Marion, Metro East)

**Climate:** Milder winters than Chicago (avg. 30°F January), hot humid summers.

**Typical system:** 60,000–80,000 BTU gas furnace + 3–3.5 ton AC

**Average full system cost:** $7,100–$10,500

Southern Illinois is the most affordable region in the state. Lower labor rates, lower cost of living, and milder winters (smaller heating equipment needed) all contribute. The Metro East area (Belleville, Edwardsville, O'Fallon) near St. Louis has slightly higher pricing than deeper southern Illinois.

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Belleville, IL — 1,600 sq ft home.** Replacing a 3-ton system with a Goodman 16 SEER2 AC + 60,000 BTU 96% furnace. Equipment: $3,800. Labor: $1,800. Materials: $450. Permits: $100. **Total: $6,150.**

## Illinois Furnace Guide: What You Need to Know

Since over 80% of Illinois homes heat with gas, furnace selection is critical. Here's your guide:

### AFUE Rating: What Efficiency Do You Need?

<ComparisonTable
  title="Furnace Efficiency Comparison for Illinois"
  headers={["AFUE Rating", "Type", "Equipment Cost Premium", "Annual Gas Cost*", "10-Year Fuel Cost"]}
  rows={[
    ["80% AFUE", "Standard efficiency", "Baseline", "$1,250", "$12,500"],
    ["92% AFUE", "High efficiency (single-stage)", "+$300–$600", "$1,087", "$10,870"],
    ["96% AFUE", "High efficiency (two-stage)", "+$800–$1,500", "$1,042", "$10,420"],
    ["98% AFUE", "Ultra-high efficiency (modulating)", "+$1,500–$3,000", "$1,020", "$10,200"]
  ]}
/>

*Based on 2,000 sq ft Chicago home using ~1,000 therms/year at $1.05/therm average.

<Callout type="tip">
**For Illinois: 96% AFUE two-stage furnaces offer the best value.** The jump from 80% to 96% saves about $208/year in gas costs. Over 15 years, that's $3,120 in savings — easily offsetting the $800–$1,500 equipment premium. Two-stage operation also provides better comfort (less temperature swing, quieter operation). The jump from 96% to 98% modulating saves only ~$22/year more and rarely justifies the $700–$1,500 additional cost.
</Callout>

### Furnace Sizing for Illinois

Illinois homes need more heating capacity than cooling capacity. Here's typical sizing:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Furnace Sizing for Illinois Homes"
  headers={["Home Size (sq ft)", "Chicago Area", "Central IL", "Southern IL"]}
  rows={[
    ["1,000–1,400", "60,000–80,000 BTU", "50,000–70,000 BTU", "40,000–60,000 BTU"],
    ["1,400–1,800", "80,000–100,000 BTU", "60,000–80,000 BTU", "50,000–70,000 BTU"],

## Heat Pumps in Illinois: Growing but Niche

Heat pumps represent a small but growing share of the Illinois HVAC market. Here's the current state of play:

**The case for heat pumps in Illinois:** Cold-climate heat pumps now work effectively down to -13°F to -22°F, covering all but the most extreme Illinois cold snaps. They provide both heating and cooling from a single system. Federal tax credits ($2,000) and utility rebates make them cost-competitive with traditional AC + furnace combos.

**The case for sticking with gas:** Illinois natural gas is cheap ($1.05/therm average). Illinois electricity is moderate (16.5¢/kWh). At current rates, a gas furnace costs about 20–30% less to operate per heating season than an air-source heat pump in northern Illinois. The economic advantage of heat pumps is weaker in Illinois than in states with expensive gas or cheap electricity.

**The best compromise: dual fuel.** A dual-fuel system pairs a heat pump with a gas furnace. The heat pump handles heating when temperatures are above 30–35°F (where it's more efficient than gas), and the furnace takes over during extreme cold. This gives you the lowest total operating cost in Illinois's climate.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Annual Heating Cost Comparison — 2,000 sq ft Chicago Home"
  headers={["System Type", "Annual Heating Cost", "Annual Cooling Cost", "Total Annual HVAC Energy"]}
  rows={[
    ["96% Gas Furnace + 16 SEER2 AC", "$1,042", "$420", "$1,462"],
    ["Cold-Climate Heat Pump (HSPF2 10)", "$1,300", "$380", "$1,680"],
    ["Dual Fuel (HP + Gas Backup)", "$920", "$380", "$1,300"],
    ["80% Gas Furnace + 14 SEER2 AC", "$1,250", "$480", "$1,730"]
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Dual-fuel wins on economics in Illinois.** It's the cheapest system to operate by $160–$430/year. The upfront cost ($12,500–$18,000) is higher than AC + furnace ($9,600–$14,200), but the $2,000 federal tax credit and $162+/year fuel savings close the gap. Payback period: 5–9 years.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How much does a new HVAC system cost in Illinois in 2026?",
    answer: "A complete HVAC system in Illinois costs $7,100–$14,200 in 2026, averaging about $9,600 for a standard AC + gas furnace replacement. The Chicago metro area averages $10,800–$15,500, while downstate Illinois (Springfield, Southern IL) averages $7,100–$11,000. Illinois is about 16% above the national average, with the Chicago premium being the primary driver."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is HVAC more expensive in Chicago than downstate Illinois?",
    answer: "Chicago HVAC costs 40–50% more than downstate due to higher labor rates ($30–$38/hour vs. $22–$28/hour), expensive permits (Chicago requires plan review for new installations, costing $200–$800), older housing stock that's harder to work in, and higher overhead costs (insurance, rent, fuel). The strong union presence in Chicago construction also pushes all wages upward."
  },
  {
    question: "What furnace efficiency should I get in Illinois?",
    answer: "A 96% AFUE two-stage furnace offers the best value for most Illinois homes. The jump from 80% to 96% efficiency saves about $208/year in gas costs at Illinois rates — $3,120 over 15 years, which easily covers the $800–$1,500 equipment premium. The jump from 96% to 98% modulating saves only $22/year more and rarely justifies the extra cost. Two-stage operation also provides better comfort with less temperature swing."
  },
  {
    question: "Are heat pumps worth it in Illinois?",
    answer: "It depends on your situation. Illinois has cheap natural gas ($1.05/therm) and moderate electricity (16.5¢/kWh), so standalone heat pumps cost about 20–30% more to operate per heating season than gas furnaces. However, dual-fuel systems (heat pump + gas furnace backup) offer the lowest total operating cost — saving $160–$430/year compared to other configurations. The $2,000 federal tax credit also helps offset the higher upfront cost of heat pump systems."
  },
  {
    question: "What HVAC rebates are available in Illinois?",
    answer: "Illinois homeowners can access the federal 25C tax credit (up to $2,000 for heat pumps, $600 for AC/furnace), ComEd rebates ($100–$1,000 for AC and heat pumps in northern IL), Ameren rebates ($100–$800 in central/southern IL), and Nicor Gas rebates ($200–$400 for high-efficiency furnaces). Income-qualified homeowners may also access HEEHRA rebates up to $8,000. Total stacked incentives can reach $2,500–$3,400+."
  },
  {
    question: "What size furnace do I need in Illinois?",
    answer: "Illinois homes typically need 40–55 BTU per square foot of heating capacity, depending on location and home characteristics. A 2,000 sq ft home in Chicago area typically needs 80,000–100,000 BTU, while the same home in southern Illinois might need only 60,000–80,000 BTU. A Manual J load calculation ($150–$300) provides accurate sizing based on your specific home's insulation, windows, and air sealing."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for HVAC replacement in Illinois?",
    answer: "In the City of Chicago, yes — mechanical permits are required for all HVAC work ($200–$800). In the suburbs, most municipalities require permits ($75–$300) for HVAC replacement, though some exempt like-for-like replacements. Downstate, requirements vary — larger cities require permits while many rural areas do not. Your contractor should know local requirements and handle permit filing."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does HVAC installation take in Illinois?",
    answer: "The actual installation takes 1–2 days for a standard AC + furnace replacement. In Chicago, the permitting process can add 1–3 weeks before work begins. In the suburbs and downstate, permits are typically processed within 1–5 business days. During peak seasons (June–August for AC, October–November for furnace), getting on a contractor's schedule may take an additional 1–3 weeks."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best time to replace HVAC in Illinois?",
    answer: "December through February offers the best pricing and fastest scheduling. Many contractors offer winter discounts of 10–20%, and wait times drop from weeks to days. Installing a furnace in January is perfectly normal — it takes 4–8 hours and your home is only without heat briefly. Avoid the summer AC rush (June–August) and fall furnace rush (October–November) for the best deals."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I replace my furnace and AC at the same time in Illinois?",
    answer: "If either system is 12+ years old, replacing both simultaneously usually saves $500–$1,500 compared to separate installations (shared labor and setup costs). Matching your furnace and AC also ensures proper airflow compatibility, which affects efficiency and comfort. The only time to replace separately is if one system is significantly newer (under 5 years old) and still under warranty."
