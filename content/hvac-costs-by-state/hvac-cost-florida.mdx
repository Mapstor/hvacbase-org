# HVAC Cost in Florida: AC, Furnace & Heat Pump Pricing for 2026

**A new HVAC system in Florida costs between $6,400 and $13,000 in 2026, with the average homeowner paying about $8,600 for a complete system replacement.** That's about 4% above the national average — reasonable considering Florida's AC runs 8–10 months per year, and the state's building code has specific hurricane and humidity requirements that other states don't face.

Florida is America's third-largest HVAC market and arguably the most AC-dependent state in the country. Your AC isn't a luxury here — it's survival equipment. This guide covers every cost detail, from Miami to Jacksonville, so you know exactly what to expect.

**Florida-specific note:** Most Florida homes use heat pumps or AC with electric air handlers rather than gas furnaces. Natural gas availability is limited in many Florida communities. If your home uses an AC + electric heat strip setup (common in Florida), your "furnace" replacement is actually an air handler replacement, which is less expensive.
</Callout>

## Why Florida HVAC Costs Are What They Are

Florida's HVAC market has unique characteristics that shape pricing:

### AC-Dominant Market

Florida homes use air conditioning more than almost any other state. Your AC compressor runs an estimated 2,800–3,500 hours per year in South Florida and 2,200–2,800 hours in North Florida — compared to 1,000–1,500 hours in northern states. This extreme usage means systems wear out faster (10–14 year average life) and replacements are frequent, which keeps the contractor market competitive.

### Florida Building Code (FBC) Requirements

Florida's building code includes requirements other states don't have:

- **Hurricane/wind resistance:** Outdoor equipment must be secured to withstand high winds. Concrete pads, hurricane straps, and elevated installations in flood-prone areas add $200–$800.
- **Energy code compliance:** Florida follows the IECC with state amendments. Load calculations and equipment efficiency minimums apply to all permitted work.
- **Permits required statewide:** Unlike Texas, Florida requires mechanical permits for HVAC replacement in every jurisdiction. Permit costs range from $150 to $500.

### Humidity Factor

Florida's extreme humidity (averaging 70–80% in summer) creates specific equipment needs. Standard single-stage AC systems often struggle with humidity control, making two-stage and variable-speed systems especially valuable here. These higher-tier systems cost more but deliver dramatically better comfort.

### Salt Air Corrosion

Homes within 10 miles of Florida's coastline face accelerated equipment corrosion from salt-laden air. Coastal installations should use equipment with coastal corrosion protection (coated coils, stainless steel hardware), which adds $300–$800 to equipment cost but extends system life by 3–5 years.

## HVAC Costs by Florida Region

### South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach)

**Climate:** Tropical. Hot and humid year-round. AC runs nearly 365 days. Minimal heating needs.

**Typical system:** 3–5 ton AC or heat pump + air handler. Gas furnaces are uncommon.

**Average full system cost:** $9,200–$14,000

South Florida is the most expensive Florida region for HVAC. Higher labor rates in the Miami metro, strict Miami-Dade County building code requirements, and the need for coastal-rated equipment all push costs up. Miami-Dade has the most stringent product approval requirements in the state — equipment must have Miami-Dade product approval (NOA, Notice of Acceptance).

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Coral Springs, FL (Broward County) — 2,000 sq ft home.** Replacing a 12-year-old 3.5-ton AC + air handler with a Carrier 17 SEER2 AC + variable-speed air handler with 10kW heat strips. Equipment: $5,400. Labor: $2,800. Hurricane pad and strapping: $350. Materials: $650. Permits: $400. **Total: $9,600.**
</Callout>

### Tampa Bay Area

**Climate:** Subtropical. Hot, humid summers. Mild winters with occasional cold fronts into the 30s–40s°F.

**Typical system:** 3–4 ton AC or heat pump + air handler

**Average full system cost:** $8,200–$12,500

Tampa Bay offers more moderate pricing than South Florida. A healthy contractor market and slightly lower labor rates help. The region's humidity demands quality equipment — variable-speed or two-stage systems are strongly recommended here.

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Clearwater, FL — 1,800 sq ft home.** Installing a 3-ton Trane 16 SEER2 heat pump + air handler, replacing an aging AC + electric heat system. Equipment: $5,200. Labor: $2,400. Materials: $550. Permits: $300. **Total: $8,450.** After federal tax credit ($2,000): **Net: $6,450.**
</Callout>

### Orlando / Central Florida

**Climate:** Subtropical. Very hot, humid summers. Cool winters with occasional freezes.

**Typical system:** 3–4 ton AC or heat pump + air handler or gas furnace (gas more common here than South FL)

**Average full system cost:** $8,000–$12,000

Central Florida benefits from competitive pricing and access to contractors from both Tampa and South Florida markets. The rapidly growing population (especially in the I-4 corridor) keeps HVAC demand high but also attracts new contractors.

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Kissimmee, FL — 2,200 sq ft home.** Replacing a 4-ton Rheem system with a new Rheem 16 SEER2 AC + 80,000 BTU gas furnace (natural gas available). Equipment: $4,800. Labor: $2,600. Materials: $600. Permits: $350. **Total: $8,350.**
</Callout>

### Jacksonville / North Florida

**Climate:** Subtropical, but with colder winters than the rest of Florida. Freezes are common December through February.

**Typical system:** 3–4 ton AC or heat pump + gas furnace or air handler with heat strips

**Average full system cost:** $7,800–$11,800

North Florida is the most affordable region in the state. Labor rates are lower, and the climate is slightly less demanding on AC systems. However, heating matters more here — you'll want reliable heating capacity, whether from a gas furnace, heat pump, or electric heat strips.

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Jacksonville, FL — 1,600 sq ft home.** Replacing a 3-ton system with a Goodman 16 SEER2 heat pump + air handler. Equipment: $4,400. Labor: $2,200. Materials: $500. Permits: $250. **Total: $7,350.** After federal tax credit ($2,000): **Net: $5,350.**
</Callout>

### Southwest Florida (Fort Myers, Naples, Sarasota)

**Climate:** Tropical to subtropical. Very hot and humid. Near year-round AC usage.

**Typical system:** 3–5 ton AC or heat pump + air handler. Coastal corrosion protection recommended.

**Average full system cost:** $8,800–$13,500

Southwest Florida pricing is elevated due to coastal corrosion concerns and an affluent market that demands premium equipment. The post-Hurricane Ian rebuilding activity in 2022–2023 also strained the local contractor workforce, and pricing has remained elevated.

<Callout type="example">
**Example: Cape Coral, FL — 2,400 sq ft home.** Replacing a hurricane-damaged 4-ton system with a Lennox 18 SEER2 AC + variable-speed air handler with coastal corrosion package. Equipment: $6,800. Labor: $3,200. Hurricane strapping and elevated pad: $600. Materials: $750. Permits: $400. **Total: $11,750.**
</Callout>

## Florida Equipment Considerations

### Heat Pump vs. AC + Heat Strips: The Florida Decision

In Florida's mild winter climate, the debate between a heat pump and an AC + electric heat strips setup comes down to efficiency and cost:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Heat Pump vs. AC + Heat Strips in Florida"
  headers={["Factor", "Heat Pump", "AC + Electric Heat Strips"]}
  rows={[
    ["Upfront Cost (3-ton)", "$5,600–$9,000", "$4,500–$7,200"],
    ["Annual Heating Cost*", "$150–$350", "$300–$650"],
    ["Annual Cooling Cost*", "Same as AC", "Same as heat pump"],
    ["Heating Efficiency", "250–350% efficient (COP 2.5–3.5)", "100% efficient"],
    ["Equipment Complexity", "Slightly more complex (reversing valve)", "Simpler"],
    ["Maintenance", "Slightly higher", "Lower"],
    ["Federal Tax Credit", "Up to $2,000", "Not eligible"],
    ["Best For", "Most Florida homes", "Homes with very minimal heating needs"]
  ]}
/>

*Based on a 2,000 sq ft home at Florida electricity rates (~15.8¢/kWh).

<Callout type="tip">
**For most Florida homeowners, a heat pump is the smarter choice.** The upfront cost premium is modest ($1,000–$2,000), it's offset by the federal tax credit ($2,000), and you'll save $150–$300/year on heating costs. The only exception is deep South Florida (Miami-Dade, Monroe County) where heating needs are so minimal that the savings don't add up.
</Callout>

### Humidity Control: Why Variable-Speed Matters in Florida

Florida's #1 comfort complaint isn't temperature — it's humidity. A standard single-stage AC cycles on and off frequently, which doesn't run long enough to dehumidify effectively. Here's how different system types handle Florida humidity:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Humidity Control by System Type"
  headers={["System Type", "Humidity Control", "Cost Premium", "Recommendation for FL"]}
  rows={[
    ["Single-Stage (basic)", "Poor — 55–65% indoor RH", "Baseline", "Acceptable for budget installs"],
    ["Two-Stage", "Good — 50–58% indoor RH", "+$800–$1,500", "Good value for Florida"],
    ["Variable-Speed (inverter)", "Excellent — 45–55% indoor RH", "+$2,000–$4,000", "Best comfort for Florida"],
    ["Add-on Dehumidifier", "Excellent — 45–50% indoor RH", "+$1,500–$3,000", "Alternative to variable-speed"]
  ]}
/>

### Coastal Corrosion Protection

If you live within 10 miles of any Florida coast (which includes the majority of the state's population), you should invest in corrosion protection:

**Standard outdoor unit life near coast:** 8–10 years (vs. 12–15 inland)

**With coastal protection package:** 11–14 years near coast

**What "coastal protection" includes:** Coated condenser coils (BlueShield, Micro Channel, or similar), stainless steel screws and hardware, coated cabinet and base pan, and weather-resistant electrical connections. Most major brands offer factory-installed coastal packages for $300–$800 extra.

## Florida HVAC Rebates and Incentives for 2026

### Federal Incentives (Available Statewide)

- **25C Tax Credit:** Up to $2,000 for qualifying heat pumps; up to $600 for AC or furnace
- **HEEHRA Rebates:** Up to $8,000 for heat pumps (income-qualified households)

### Florida Utility Rebates

/>

<Callout type="tip">
**FPL customers** (who represent about half of Florida) can also take advantage of FPL's On Call program, which provides free AC maintenance and repairs for a monthly fee. While not a direct installation rebate, it can save significant money on ongoing maintenance after your new system is installed.
</Callout>

### Florida-Specific Programs

**Florida PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy):** PACE financing allows you to finance HVAC improvements through a property tax assessment. No upfront cost, and payments spread over 10–20 years. Available in most Florida counties. Interest rates are typically 6–9%.

**Solar + HVAC Combo:** Many Florida solar installers offer discounted HVAC installation when bundled with a solar panel installation. This can save $1,000–$3,000 on the HVAC portion.

<Callout type="warning">
**PACE financing caution:** While PACE makes new HVAC accessible with zero upfront cost, the total cost over the loan term is significantly higher than paying cash or using a traditional loan. PACE assessments also become a lien on your property, which can complicate selling your home. Read all terms carefully before signing.
</Callout>

## Florida Permit Process: What to Expect

Florida requires mechanical permits for all HVAC installations statewide. Here's how the process works:

**Step 1: Contractor pulls permit.** Your HVAC contractor should handle this. Permit fees range from $150 to $500 depending on county.

**Step 2: Installation.** Standard installations take 1–2 days.

**Step 3: Inspection.** A county building inspector visits to verify the installation meets Florida Building Code. Typical wait time: 3–7 business days after installation.

**Step 4: Final approval.** The inspector signs off, and the permit is closed. You should receive a copy of the closed permit for your records.

<ComparisonTable

  headers={["County", "Permit Fee", "Typical Inspection Wait"]}
  rows={[
    ["Miami-Dade", "$300–$500", "5–10 business days"],
    ["Broward", "$250–$450", "3–7 business days"],
    ["Palm Beach", "$200–$400", "3–5 business days"],

    ["Lee (Fort Myers)", "$200–$400", "3–7 business days"],
    ["Pinellas (St. Pete)", "$150–$350", "3–5 business days"]
  ]}
/>

## Seasonal Pricing in Florida

Florida's HVAC market has a somewhat different seasonal pattern than northern states:

**Peak season (April–September):** AC demand skyrockets. Emergency replacements during summer heat command 15–20% premiums. Wait times: 1–3 weeks for non-emergency installs.

**Hurricane season overlay (June–November):** After major storms, HVAC contractors are booked for weeks or months with damage restoration and replacement. Post-hurricane pricing can spike 20–40%.

**Off-season (November–February):** Best pricing window. Contractor demand drops, and many offer 10–15% seasonal discounts. Wait times: 3–7 days.

**Shoulder season (March, October):** Moderate pricing and availability. A good time to get quotes.

<Callout type="tip">
**Florida pro tip:** Schedule your replacement for December or January. Contractors are slowest, prices are lowest, and you'll have a brand-new, efficient system ready for the spring/summer heat. Don't wait until your AC dies in July — that's the most expensive, most stressful way to replace your system.
</Callout>

## Finding a Licensed Florida HVAC Contractor

Florida requires HVAC contractors to hold a state license issued by the Construction Industry Licensing Board (CILB) through the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR).

**License types:** Florida issues two classes — Certified (statewide) and Registered (county-specific). Certified contractors can work anywhere in the state. Registered contractors are limited to the county where they're registered.

**Verify online.** Visit myfloridalicense.com to search for any contractor. Look up their license type, status, and any complaints.

**Insurance.** Florida requires licensed contractors to carry general liability insurance and workers' compensation. Ask for certificates of insurance.

**Specific to look for:**
- CAC (Class A Air Conditioning Contractor) license for unlimited HVAC work
- CMC (Class B Mechanical Contractor) license also covers HVAC
- Verify the license is active and in good standing

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How much does a new HVAC system cost in Florida in 2026?",
    answer: "A complete HVAC system in Florida costs $6,400–$13,000 in 2026, with the average homeowner paying about $8,600. Heat pump systems average $9,800. Costs vary by region — South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward) is the most expensive at $9,200–$14,000, while North Florida (Jacksonville area) is most affordable at $7,800–$11,800. These prices include equipment, labor, materials, permits, and hurricane-code compliance."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get a heat pump or AC with heat strips in Florida?",
    answer: "For most Florida homeowners, a heat pump is the better investment. While a heat pump costs $1,000–$2,000 more upfront than AC + heat strips, the $2,000 federal tax credit more than offsets this. Heat pumps also save $150–$300/year on heating costs by operating at 250–350% efficiency versus 100% for electric heat strips. The only exception is deep South Florida where heating needs are minimal."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do HVAC systems last in Florida?",
    answer: "HVAC systems in Florida typically last 10–14 years, shorter than the 15–20 year average in northern states. The extended cooling season (8–10 months of AC usage), high humidity, and salt air exposure near the coast all accelerate wear. Coastal homes without corrosion protection may see equipment last only 8–10 years. Regular maintenance (twice yearly) and corrosion protection extend system life."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for HVAC replacement in Florida?",
    answer: "Yes. Florida requires mechanical permits for all HVAC installations statewide, including like-for-like replacements. Permit costs range from $150 to $500 depending on county. Your HVAC contractor should pull the permit as part of the job. An inspection by a county building inspector follows installation (typically 3–7 business days). Never skip permits — it can void warranties and create problems when selling your home."
  },
  {
    question: "What HVAC rebates are available in Florida for 2026?",
    answer: "Florida homeowners can access the federal 25C tax credit (up to $2,000 for heat pumps, $600 for AC), HEEHRA rebates (up to $8,000 for income-qualified heat pump installations), and utility rebates ($150–$500 from FPL, Duke Energy, TECO, JEA, and others). PACE financing is also available in most Florida counties for zero-upfront-cost HVAC installation, though total costs are higher over the loan term."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does humidity matter for HVAC choice in Florida?",
    answer: "Florida's extreme humidity (70–80% outdoors in summer) is the primary comfort challenge. Basic single-stage AC systems cycle on and off too quickly to adequately dehumidify, leaving indoor humidity at 55–65% (uncomfortable and mold-promoting). Two-stage systems maintain 50–58% indoor humidity, while variable-speed systems achieve 45–55%. The upgrade to two-stage costs $800–$1,500 extra and is strongly recommended for Florida homes."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need coastal corrosion protection for my HVAC?",
    answer: "If you live within 10 miles of any Florida coastline, yes. Salt air corrodes standard condenser coils, hardware, and electrical connections, reducing system life from 12–15 years to 8–10 years. Coastal protection packages (coated coils, stainless hardware, protected cabinet) cost $300–$800 extra and extend equipment life by 3–5 years near the coast. Most major brands offer factory-installed coastal packages."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best time to replace HVAC in Florida?",
    answer: "December through February is the best time — contractor demand is lowest, scheduling is fastest (3–7 days vs. 1–3 weeks in summer), and many companies offer seasonal discounts of 10–15%. Avoid summer emergency replacements (April–September) when prices are highest. Also be aware that post-hurricane periods can spike pricing 20–40% due to contractor demand for damage restoration."
  },
  {
    question: "What size AC system do I need for my Florida home?",
    answer: "Florida homes typically need 1 ton of cooling per 500–550 sq ft. A 2,000 sq ft home in Central Florida usually needs a 3.5–4 ton system, while the same home in South Florida might need 4–4.5 tons due to higher heat loads. A Manual J load calculation ($150–$300) gives the most accurate sizing by accounting for insulation, windows, orientation, and local climate. Oversizing causes humidity problems — critical to avoid in Florida."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I check if a Florida HVAC contractor is licensed?",
    answer: "Visit myfloridalicense.com and search by contractor name or license number. Look for an active CAC (Class A Air Conditioning Contractor) or CMC (Class B Mechanical Contractor) license. Certified licenses are valid statewide; Registered licenses are county-specific. Check for any complaints or disciplinary actions. Also verify general liability and workers' compensation insurance before work begins."
