# How to Identify Mold in Your Home: Visual Guide + Testing Methods

You can identify mold visually by looking for discolored patches (black, green, white, orange, or pink) on walls, ceilings, and other surfaces, and by smell — mold produces a distinctive musty, earthy odor even when it's hidden behind walls or under flooring. If you see suspicious discoloration, the simplest confirmation test is to dab a drop of household bleach on the spot: if it lightens within 1–2 minutes, it's almost certainly mold; if it doesn't change, it's likely dirt or mineral staining.

Mold is present in virtually every home — the CDC estimates that indoor air typically contains 1,000–10,000 mold spores per cubic meter, and that's normal. The concern is when mold colonizes a surface and begins actively growing, releasing concentrated spores that degrade air quality, damage building materials, and trigger health symptoms in roughly **25% of the population** who are genetically predisposed to mold sensitivity.

## Visual Mold Identification: Color-by-Color Guide

Mold comes in dozens of species commonly found in homes, and color is your first identification clue. However, color alone isn't definitive — many species can appear in multiple colors, and environmental conditions change mold's appearance. Here's what each color typically indicates.

### Mold Color Identification Chart

| Color | Common Species | Typical Locations | Health Risk | Urgency |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| Black / Dark Green | *Stachybotrys chartarum*, *Aspergillus niger*, *Cladosporium* | Water-damaged drywall, chronically wet areas, air ducts | Moderate to High | Act immediately |
| Green | *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*, *Cladosporium* | Walls, fabrics, food, HVAC systems | Low to Moderate | Address within 1–2 weeks |
| White | *Penicillium*, *Aspergillus*, *Sclerotinia* | Crawl spaces, attics, wood surfaces, concrete | Low to Moderate | Address within 2–4 weeks |
| Yellow | *Aspergillus flavus*, *Serpula lacrymans* | Water-damaged materials, crawl spaces | Moderate (produces aflatoxins) | Act within 1 week |
| Orange / Pink | *Acremonium*, *Fusarium*, bacteria (Serratia) | Bathroom grout, shower tiles, humidifier reservoirs | Low to Moderate | Address within 2–4 weeks |
| Brown | *Stemonitis*, *Aureobasidium* | Wood surfaces, window sills, HVAC components | Low | Address within 2–4 weeks |
| Gray | Early-stage *Aspergillus*, *Botrytis* | Concrete, stone, damp fabrics | Low to Moderate | Address within 2 weeks |

<Callout type="warning">
**About "Black Mold":** The term "black mold" is widely used to refer to *Stachybotrys chartarum*, which produces mycotoxins (specifically satratoxins). However, many harmless mold species are also black in color, and *Stachybotrys* itself can appear dark green. Color alone does not confirm the species. If you see significant black mold growth (more than a few square feet), professional testing is worthwhile to identify the species before deciding on a remediation approach.

### Mold vs. Not Mold: Common Look-Alikes

Before you panic, confirm that what you're seeing is actually mold. Several common household substances mimic mold's appearance:

| Substance | Looks Like | How to Tell the Difference |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Efflorescence (mineral deposits) | White fuzzy mold on concrete/brick | Dissolves in water; mold doesn't. Efflorescence is crystalline up close. |
| Dirt or soot | Black mold on walls/ceilings | Doesn't respond to bleach test. No musty odor. |
| Soap scum | White/gray mold in bathrooms | Smooth texture; mold is fuzzy or slimy. Wipes off easily with soap. |
| Hard water stains | Orange/brown mold on fixtures | Uniform pattern following water flow. No fuzzy texture. |
| Ghost marking (dust on cold spots) | Dark mold lines on ceilings | Follows framing pattern exactly. Smudgy, not fuzzy. |
| Wood tannin bleed | Dark mold stains on wood | Appears immediately after wetting. No musty odor. |

### The Bleach Drop Test

This is the fastest at-home confirmation method:

1. Dip a cotton swab in regular household bleach (sodium hypochlorite)
2. Dab it on the suspicious spot
3. Wait 1–2 minutes
4. **If the spot lightens or disappears:** It's mold or mildew (organic growth that bleach kills)
5. **If the spot doesn't change:** It's likely dirt, soot, mineral deposits, or staining

This test doesn't tell you the species, but it confirms biological growth.

## Where to Look: Hidden Mold Hotspots

Visible mold on a wall is often just the tip of the iceberg. For every square foot of visible mold, there may be 3–10 times more hidden behind the surface. Here are the locations to inspect systematically.

### High-Priority Inspection Points

| Location | What to Look For | How to Check | Frequency |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Behind and under kitchen/bathroom sinks | Discoloration on cabinet bottom, musty odor | Pull everything out, inspect with flashlight | Monthly |
| Behind refrigerator | Black spots on wall, wet floor | Pull fridge out annually | Annually |
| Around windows (especially single-pane) | Condensation stains, soft/discolored frames | Visual check, feel for soft spots | Weekly in winter |
| Bathroom ceiling and upper walls | Discoloration, peeling paint | Visual inspection after shower steam clears | Weekly |
| HVAC air handler / evaporator coil | Visible growth on coil fins, musty air from vents | Remove access panel, shine flashlight | Every 6 months |
| Supply and return air vents | Dark streaks around vents, fuzzy growth on vent louvers | Remove vent cover, inspect inside duct opening | Every 3 months |
| Attic (roof decking underside) | Dark staining on plywood, especially near bathroom exhaust | Enter attic with flashlight, check near penetrations | Every 6 months |
| Basement walls (below grade) | White efflorescence or fuzzy growth, especially at base | Visual inspection, check behind stored items | Monthly |
| Crawl space | Growth on floor joists, vapor barrier, insulation | Enter with flashlight and respirator | Every 3–6 months |
| Washing machine rubber gasket (front-load) | Black residue on door seal | Peel back gasket folds | Weekly |
| Drip pans (AC, dehumidifier) | Slimy residue, discolored water | Visual inspection | Monthly |
| Closets on exterior walls | Musty odor, spots on clothing or walls | Move items, inspect corners | Monthly |

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example: Hidden Kitchen Mold (Denver, CO)**
A homeowner in Denver noticed a persistent musty smell in their kitchen but couldn't see any mold. After checking the obvious spots (under the sink, around the dishwasher), they pulled out the refrigerator and found a 4-square-foot patch of black mold (*Cladosporium*) on the drywall behind it. The cause: a slow leak from the refrigerator's ice maker water line that had been dripping for months. The fix involved replacing the water line ($25), removing the affected drywall section, treating the studs with a mold biocide, and installing new drywall ($400 total DIY, or approximately $800–$1,200 professional).
</Callout>

## Signs of Mold You Can't See

Not all mold is visible. Here are the non-visual indicators that suggest hidden mold growth.

### Odor Identification

Mold produces microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) that have a distinctive smell. Different mold species produce different odor profiles:

| Odor Description | Likely Cause | Urgency |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| Musty, earthy (like old books or damp basement) | General mold growth, likely *Aspergillus* or *Penicillium* | Moderate — investigate within 1 week |
| Sweet, fermenting | Active fungal metabolism, potentially *Stachybotrys* | High — investigate immediately |
| Sharp, ammonia-like | Bacterial growth alongside mold | High — may indicate sewage or contaminated water source |
| Rotting wood | *Serpula lacrymans* (dry rot) or advanced *Meruliporia* | High — structural damage possible |

**The Nose Test:** If you notice a musty smell that gets stronger when the HVAC system runs, the mold is likely in the ductwork, air handler, or evaporator coil. If the smell is localized to one room, the source is likely behind the walls, under the floor, or above the ceiling in that area.

### Health Symptoms as Indicators

If multiple household members develop these symptoms that improve when they leave the house, hidden mold is a strong possibility:

- Persistent nasal congestion and sinus pressure
- Sneezing, runny nose, or post-nasal drip that doesn't respond to allergy medication
- Itchy, watery, or red eyes
- Throat irritation or persistent cough
- Skin rashes or hives
- Headaches that occur primarily at home
- Fatigue and difficulty concentrating
- Worsening asthma symptoms

<Callout type="info">
**Important:** Approximately 25% of the population carries the HLA-DR gene that makes them significantly more sensitive to mold exposure. If one household member experiences symptoms but others don't, it doesn't mean there's no mold — it may mean that person is genetically more susceptible. The absence of symptoms in some family members is not evidence that the home is mold-free.
</Callout>

### Structural Indicators

| Sign | What It Suggests | Action |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Peeling or bubbling paint | Moisture behind the wall surface | Investigate moisture source; check for mold behind the paint |
| Warped or buckled flooring | Moisture underneath (subfloor or slab) | Check subfloor moisture with a pin meter |
| Soft or spongy drywall | Prolonged moisture exposure, possible internal mold | Carefully cut a small inspection hole |
| Stained ceiling tiles | Roof leak or condensation from above | Check attic/roof above the stain |
| Rust on metal pipes or fasteners | Chronic high humidity | Check humidity levels; inspect surrounding materials |
| Condensation on windows | Excessive indoor humidity | Measure RH; improve ventilation |

## Mold Testing: DIY vs. Professional

Testing confirms the presence, type, and concentration of mold. Here's when you need it and which method to choose.

### When You Do and Don't Need Testing

**You DON'T need testing if:**
- You can see visible mold and already plan to remediate it (the EPA recommends treating all mold the same — remove it, regardless of species)
- The affected area is small (under 10 square feet) and the moisture source is obvious and fixable

**You DO need testing if:**
- You smell mold but can't find it visually
- You or family members are experiencing health symptoms
- You're buying or selling a home and need documentation
- Post-remediation verification is needed (clearance testing)
- An insurance claim is involved
- The affected area is large (over 10 square feet) or involves HVAC systems

### Testing Methods Compared

| Test Type | What It Measures | Cost (DIY) | Cost (Professional) | Accuracy | Best For |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|--------------------|-|-|
| Surface tape lift | Mold species on a specific surface | $30–$50 per kit | $200–$300 per sample | High for surface ID | Confirming visible mold species |
| Air sampling (spore trap) | Airborne mold spore concentration | $40–$70 per kit | $250–$500 (2–3 samples typical) | High | Detecting hidden mold, air quality assessment |
| Bulk/swab culture | Living mold species identification | $30–$60 per kit | $150–$250 per sample | High | Species-specific identification |
| ERMI (Environmental Relative Moldiness Index) | DNA-based analysis of 36 mold species | $150–$250 (dust sample kit) | $300–$500 | Very High | Comprehensive mold profile, pre-purchase assessment |
| Moisture meter survey | Identifies moisture in materials (not mold directly) | $30–$80 (buy a pin meter) | Included in professional inspection | High for locating moisture | Finding hidden moisture sources |
| Thermal imaging | Temperature differentials indicating moisture | $200–$400 (buy camera) | $200–$400 (inspection) | Moderate (requires interpretation) | Non-destructive moisture detection |

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example: ERMI Testing Before Home Purchase (Charlotte, NC)**
A homebuyer in Charlotte ordered an ERMI test ($275 kit with lab analysis) before purchasing a 30-year-old home that had a musty smell in the basement. The ERMI score came back at 11.2, which is in the "high mold burden" category (scores above 5 are considered elevated). The detailed species breakdown showed elevated *Stachybotrys* and *Chaetomium* — both water-damage indicator species. This gave the buyer leverage to negotiate $12,000 off the purchase price for remediation, plus a $2,000 credit for a post-remediation clearance test. Without testing, they would have purchased the home at full price and discovered the problem later.
</Callout>

### DIY Testing: Step-by-Step

If you're going the DIY route, here's how to get useful results:

**For air sampling (most common DIY test):**

1. Purchase a mold test kit with laboratory analysis included (e.g., Pro-Lab MO109, HomeBiotics, or ImmunoLytics)
2. Close all windows and doors for 24 hours before testing (this concentrates any airborne spores)
3. Set the test cassette or settle plate in the center of the room, 3–5 feet above the floor
4. Follow the kit's exposure time exactly (typically 5–10 minutes for cassette tests, or 1 hour to overnight for settle plates)
5. Seal the sample and mail it to the lab
6. **Critical:** Also take an outdoor control sample. Indoor mold levels should be lower than outdoor levels. If indoor is higher, you have active indoor growth.
7. Results typically arrive in 5–7 business days

**For surface testing:**

1. Purchase surface tape lift or swab kits
2. Press tape firmly onto the suspect surface for 30 seconds
3. Remove and seal in the provided container
4. Mail to the lab for analysis
5. Results will identify the species present

### Professional Mold Inspection: What to Expect

A professional mold inspection typically costs $300–$700 for a standard home and includes:

| Service | What's Included | Typical Cost |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Visual inspection | Systematic examination of all accessible areas | Included in inspection fee |
| Moisture mapping | Pin and pinless meter readings throughout the home | Included |
| Thermal imaging | Infrared camera scan for hidden moisture | Sometimes included; $100–$200 extra if separate |
| Air sampling | 2–3 spore trap samples (indoor + outdoor control) | $150–$300 (2–3 samples) |
| Surface sampling | Tape lift or swab of visible growth | $100–$200 per sample |
| Lab analysis | Identification and quantification by a certified lab | Included in sample costs |
| Written report | Findings, species identified, recommended action | Included |

<Callout type="warning">
**Red Flags When Hiring a Mold Inspector:**
- **Avoid companies that both inspect AND remediate.** This is a conflict of interest — they have a financial incentive to find problems. A good inspector should be independent of the remediation company.
- Demand that the inspector is **certified** by ACAC (American Council for Accredited Certification), IICRC, or holds a state license if your state requires one.
- Be suspicious if they try to sell you air purifiers, ozone machines, or proprietary treatments during the inspection.
- A legitimate inspector will send samples to an **AIHA-accredited laboratory** (check at aihaaccreditedlabs.org).
</Callout>

## Mold Identification by Location

Different areas of your home favor different mold species. Knowing what to expect helps you identify problems faster.

### Bathroom Mold

Bathrooms are the most common mold location in any home. Warm, wet conditions after every shower create an ideal growth environment.

| Bathroom Surface | Common Mold/Growth | Appearance | Severity |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| Grout lines | *Cladosporium*, *Aureobasidium* | Dark spots or lines between tiles | Low — surface mold, easy to clean |
| Silicone caulk | *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium* | Pink/orange or black discoloration | Low — replace caulk if it won't clean |
| Ceiling above shower | *Aspergillus*, *Stachybotrys* | Dark spots, peeling paint | Moderate — indicates ventilation problem |
| Behind shower surround | *Stachybotrys*, *Chaetomium* | Not visible from front; musty odor | High — may require demo to access |
| Under vanity/sink | *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium* | Green or white fuzzy growth | Moderate — often caused by slow leak |

### HVAC System Mold

Mold in the HVAC system is particularly insidious because it distributes spores throughout the entire home.

| HVAC Component | Mold Risk Level | Visual Signs | Smell Sign |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Evaporator coil | High (constantly wet during cooling) | Dark coating on coil fins | Musty air from all vents |
| Condensate drain pan | High (standing water) | Slimy brown/black residue | Musty smell near air handler |
| Supply ductwork | Moderate (condensation in uninsulated ducts) | Dark streaks visible inside vents | Musty smell from specific vents |
| Return ductwork | Moderate (draws in spores from house) | Fuzzy growth on duct liner | Musty smell at return grille |
| Air handler cabinet | Moderate (adjacent to wet coil) | Dark spots on interior walls of cabinet | General musty smell |

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example: HVAC Mold Discovery (Tampa, FL)**
A family in Tampa noticed that their allergies were significantly worse at home than elsewhere. Air sampling revealed *Aspergillus* and *Penicillium* spore counts at 12,000 spores/m³ indoors versus 2,500 spores/m³ outdoors — nearly 5x the outdoor level. A visual inspection of the HVAC system found heavy mold growth on the evaporator coil, drain pan, and the first 6 feet of supply ductwork. The root cause: the condensate drain had been partially clogged for over a year, keeping the drain pan perpetually wet. Remediation involved professional coil cleaning ($350), drain pan treatment ($150), duct cleaning ($450), and drain line repair ($100). After remediation, indoor spore counts dropped to 1,800/m³ — below outdoor levels, which is the target.
</Callout>

### Basement and Crawl Space Mold

| Surface | Common Mold | Appearance | Root Cause |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| Concrete block walls | *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*, efflorescence (not mold) | White powdery (efflorescence) or fuzzy white/green (mold) | Moisture wicking through foundation |
| Floor joists (crawl space) | *Aspergillus*, *Trichoderma* | White or green fuzzy growth on wood underside | High crawl space humidity |
| Rim joist / sill plate | *Aspergillus*, *Cladosporium* | Dark staining on wood | Condensation, air leakage |
| Stored items (cardboard, fabric) | *Penicillium*, *Aspergillus* | Green, white, or gray fuzzy growth | Stored organic materials in humid space |

### Attic Mold

| Surface | Common Mold | Appearance | Root Cause |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| Roof decking (plywood underside) | *Aspergillus*, *Cladosporium*, *Stachybotrys* | Dark staining, black spots | Inadequate ventilation, bathroom fan venting into attic |
| Rafters | *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium* | Gray to black discoloration | Condensation from inadequate ventilation |
| Insulation (facing) | *Cladosporium*, *Penicillium* | Discolored vapor barrier, musty odor | Moisture intrusion from above or below |

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example: Attic Mold from Bathroom Fan (Minneapolis, MN)**
A homeowner discovered extensive black mold on the roof decking in their attic during a home sale inspection. The cause: the bathroom exhaust fan duct had disconnected from the roof vent and was blowing warm, moisture-laden air directly into the cold attic space for two years. The moisture condensed on the cold roof decking and fueled *Cladosporium* growth across approximately 200 square feet of plywood. Remediation cost $4,800 (media blasting the roof decking, HEPA vacuuming, antimicrobial treatment, and sealing). Reconnecting and properly insulating the exhaust duct cost $175. Total cost of the preventable mistake: nearly $5,000.
</Callout>

## Understanding Mold Test Results

If you've had testing done, here's how to interpret the numbers.

### Air Sampling Results Interpretation

| Metric | Normal Range | Elevated | Action Level |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Total spore count (indoor) | Below outdoor level | 1.5–3x outdoor level | Above 3x outdoor level |
| *Aspergillus/Penicillium* | Below 1,000/m³ | 1,000–5,000/m³ | Above 5,000/m³ |
| *Stachybotrys* | 0–50/m³ (ideally 0) | 50–200/m³ | Above 200/m³ — investigate immediately |
| *Chaetomium* | 0–50/m³ (ideally 0) | 50–200/m³ | Above 200/m³ — water damage indicator |
| *Cladosporium* | Below 2,000/m³ | 2,000–5,000/m³ | Above 5,000/m³ |

### ERMI Score Interpretation

| ERMI Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Below −4 | Low mold burden | No action needed |
| −4 to 0 | Below average mold burden | No action needed |
| 0 to 5 | Average mold burden | Monitor; address any visible moisture issues |
| 5 to 10 | Elevated mold burden | Investigate moisture sources; consider remediation |
| Above 10 | High mold burden | Professional inspection and likely remediation recommended |

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Key Takeaways:**
- Color is a first clue but doesn't definitively identify mold species — black mold isn't always *Stachybotrys*
- Use the bleach drop test to quickly confirm biological growth vs. dirt or mineral deposits
- A musty smell, especially when the HVAC runs, strongly suggests hidden mold — don't ignore it
- Health symptoms that improve away from home are a red flag for hidden mold exposure
- DIY test kits ($30–$70) are sufficient for basic confirmation; professional testing ($300–$700) is worth it for health concerns, home sales, or insurance claims
- Always hire an independent inspector — never use a company that both inspects and remediates
- Indoor mold spore counts should be lower than outdoor counts; anything higher indicates active indoor growth

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "What does mold smell like?",
    answer: "Mold produces a distinctive musty, earthy odor often compared to wet socks, damp cardboard, or an old basement. The smell comes from microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) that mold releases as metabolic byproducts. Different species produce slightly different odors — some are more sour or sweet — but the general 'musty' character is consistent. If you notice this smell in a specific area of your home or when your HVAC system runs, investigate immediately."
  },
  {
    question: "Can mold be behind walls with no visible signs?",
    answer: "Yes, and this is extremely common. Mold can grow extensively behind drywall, under flooring, above ceiling tiles, and inside wall cavities without any visible surface signs for months. The telltale indicators are musty odor, unexplained allergy symptoms, or moisture readings above 16% on a pin-type moisture meter pushed into the wall. A thermal imaging camera can also reveal cool, damp spots behind walls that suggest hidden moisture and potential mold."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I tell the difference between mold and mildew?",
    answer: "Mildew is actually a type of mold — specifically, it refers to flat, surface-level mold growth that's typically white, gray, or light yellow. Mildew grows on surfaces and is easy to wipe away. What people call 'mold' usually refers to deeper, fuzzy or slimy growth that's often darker in color (black, green, brown) and has penetrated into the material. Mildew is generally a cosmetic and minor health issue. Deeper mold growth often indicates a more serious moisture problem and may require material removal."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I test for mold or just remediate if I can see it?",
    answer: "If you can see mold and the area is small (under 10 square feet), the EPA recommends simply removing it without testing — all mold should be removed regardless of species. Testing becomes valuable when: you smell mold but can't find it, you need documentation for insurance or a real estate transaction, you're experiencing health symptoms and want to quantify the exposure, or you need post-remediation clearance testing to confirm successful cleanup."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the most dangerous type of household mold?",
    answer: "Stachybotrys chartarum (commonly called 'black mold' or 'toxic mold') is considered the most concerning household mold because it produces mycotoxins called satratoxins. However, the term 'toxic mold' is somewhat misleading — the mold itself isn't toxic, but the mycotoxins it produces can cause health effects including respiratory problems, neurological symptoms, and immune suppression in susceptible individuals. Other concerning species include Aspergillus fumigatus (can cause invasive infections in immunocompromised people) and Chaetomium (produces chaetoglobosin toxins)."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are DIY mold test kits?",
    answer: "DIY surface tape lift and swab kits analyzed by an accredited lab are reasonably accurate for identifying mold species present on a specific surface. DIY air sampling kits (settle plates or cassettes) are less reliable than professional air sampling because they lack calibrated air pumps and standardized protocols. The biggest limitation of DIY testing is interpretation — without comparative data and professional judgment, it's easy to misread results. If health concerns are involved, professional testing ($300–$700) is worth the investment."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see mold spores in the air?",
    answer: "No. Individual mold spores are microscopic, typically 1–30 microns in diameter (a human hair is about 70 microns). You cannot see mold spores floating in the air with the naked eye. What you can sometimes see is concentrated spore release from a mold colony — this may look like a faint puff of dust when the colony is disturbed. The visible parts of mold are the mycelium (root structure) and the sporangia (spore-producing structures) on a surface."
  },
  {
    question: "What does mold look like in the early stages?",
    answer: "Early-stage mold typically appears as small, faint discolored spots — often light gray, white, or slightly greenish — that may be mistaken for dirt or water stains. On drywall, it often starts at corners, edges, or around fixtures where moisture accumulates. On grout, it first appears as light spotting between tiles. Early mold may not yet produce a strong odor. At this stage, it's surface-level and easy to clean. Within 1–2 weeks without treatment, the spots darken, expand, and develop the fuzzy or slimy texture associated with established colonies."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I check for mold in my HVAC system?",
    answer: "Turn off the system, then remove the access panel to the air handler and inspect the evaporator coil and drain pan with a flashlight — look for dark coating on the coil fins, slimy residue in the pan, or any fuzzy growth. Next, remove a few supply register covers and look 2–3 feet into the ductwork for dark streaks or growth on the duct liner. Finally, turn the system on and check for musty odor from the vents. If you find mold on the coil or in the ducts, hire an HVAC professional — duct cleaning alone costs $400–$800, and coil cleaning runs $150–$400."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a moisture meter detect mold?",
    answer: "A moisture meter doesn't detect mold directly — it measures moisture content in building materials. However, it's one of the most useful tools for mold investigation because persistently elevated moisture (above 16% in wood, above 1% in concrete) indicates conditions that support mold growth. Professional mold inspectors always use moisture meters during inspections. A good pin-type moisture meter costs $30–$80 and is a worthwhile investment for any homeowner, especially after water damage events."
