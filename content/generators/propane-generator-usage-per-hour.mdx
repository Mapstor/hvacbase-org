# How Much Propane Do Generators Use Per Hour?

A typical home standby generator uses 2–4 gallons of propane per hour at full load, or 1–2 gallons per hour at the 50% load you will run during most outages. A 22kW generator — the most popular size for whole-home backup — burns approximately 2.5 gallons per hour at 75% load, costing about $7.00/hour at 2026 propane prices.

Those numbers determine everything: how big your tank needs to be, how much each outage costs, and how long you can run before needing a refill. Below are the exact consumption rates for every common generator size, along with tank runtime charts and a calculator you can use for your specific setup.

<Callout type="info">
**Why 50% load matters most:** During a typical power outage, your generator cycles between high-draw periods (AC compressor on, water heater heating) and low-draw periods (just lights and fridge). The average load over a 24-hour period is usually 40–60% of rated capacity. Use the 50% column for the most realistic runtime and cost estimates.

## How Long Will Your Propane Tank Last?

The runtime of your propane tank depends on three things: tank size, fill level (tanks are filled to 80% capacity for thermal expansion safety), and your average consumption rate.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Florida Hurricane Prep:**
A homeowner in Fort Myers has a 22kW Generac Guardian with a 500-gallon propane tank (400 usable gallons). During a 5-day post-hurricane outage at 50% average load, the generator consumes 2.0 gal/hr × 120 hours = 240 gallons. At $2.80/gallon, that is **$672 in propane.** The 500-gallon tank has enough capacity with 160 gallons to spare.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Midwest Ice Storm:**
A homeowner in rural Missouri runs a 14kW Kohler with a 250-gallon tank (200 usable gallons). A 3-day ice storm at 50% load consumes 1.4 gal/hr × 72 hours = 100.8 gallons. Cost: **$282.** The tank still has about 100 gallons remaining — enough for another 3 days.

## Propane Tank Sizing Guide

Choosing the right tank size is critical. Too small, and you run out mid-outage. Too large, and you waste money on a tank you do not need.

<Callout type="tip">
Most propane companies offer tank leasing programs where you pay a small annual fee ($75–$200) instead of buying the tank outright. The catch: you must buy propane exclusively from that company. If you have competitive propane pricing in your area, owning your tank gives you the freedom to shop for the best rates.

## How Temperature Affects Propane Consumption

Propane is stored as a liquid under pressure. When it gets cold, the liquid's ability to vaporize (turn into gas) decreases. This has two effects on your generator.

Below 0°F, a propane tank may not vaporize fuel fast enough to keep a large generator running at full load. This is called "freeze-up" and it is more common with smaller tanks that have less liquid surface area for vaporization.

Cold weather also increases your electrical load because your heating system runs harder, which means the generator consumes more propane. A 22kW generator that averages 50% load in summer may average 70% load in winter.

Wait — gasoline costs less per hour? Yes, at current prices, gasoline has a lower hourly cost than propane because gasoline has more energy per gallon (120,238 BTU vs. 91,500 BTU). However, propane has other advantages: indefinite shelf life, cleaner combustion, lower maintenance costs, and on-site tank storage that does not depend on gas station availability.

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Key Takeaways:**
- A 22kW generator uses approximately 2.0 gallons of propane per hour at 50% load.
- At $2.80/gallon, that is $5.60/hour or $134/day for whole-home backup.
- A 500-gallon tank provides roughly 8 days of runtime at 50% load for a 22kW generator.
- Use the 50% load column for the most realistic estimates — that is what most homes average.
- Cold weather increases both propane consumption (higher load) and may reduce tank vaporization.
- Tank size recommendation: 250-gallon for 3-day backup, 500-gallon for 7-day backup.
- Never let your tank drop below 20% — schedule refills early during outage season.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How many gallons of propane does a 22kW generator use per hour?",
      answer: "A 22kW generator uses approximately 1.1 gallons/hour at 25% load, 2.0 gallons/hour at 50% load, 2.9 gallons/hour at 75% load, and 3.8 gallons/hour at full load. Most homes average about 50% load during outages, so budget for roughly 2 gallons per hour."
    },
    {
      question: "How long will a 500-gallon propane tank run a generator?",
      answer: "A 500-gallon tank (400 usable gallons at 80% fill) will run a 22kW generator for approximately 200 hours (8.3 days) at 50% load, or 138 hours (5.7 days) at 75% load. For a smaller 14kW generator, the same tank lasts about 286 hours (11.9 days) at 50% load."
    },
    {
      question: "How long will a 100-pound propane tank run a generator?",
      answer: "A 100-pound propane tank holds approximately 23.6 gallons. On a 22kW generator at 50% load (2.0 gal/hr), it lasts about 12 hours. On a smaller 5,500W portable at 50% load (0.7 gal/hr), it lasts approximately 34 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "How long will a 20-pound BBQ propane tank run a generator?",
      answer: "A standard 20-pound BBQ tank holds about 4.7 gallons of propane. On a 3,500W portable at 50% load (0.5 gal/hr), it lasts approximately 9.4 hours. On a larger 7,500W portable at 50% load (0.9 gal/hr), it lasts about 5.2 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it cheaper to run a generator on propane or gasoline?",
      answer: "In 2026, gasoline is actually slightly cheaper per hour than propane because gasoline has higher energy content per gallon. However, propane has significant non-cost advantages: indefinite shelf life, cleaner burning (less maintenance), on-site storage, and availability during outages when gas stations may be closed."
    },
    {
      question: "How much propane does a generator use for weekly testing?",
      answer: "A 20kW standby generator running its 30-minute weekly exercise cycle at roughly 50% load uses about 0.9 gallons of propane per test. At $2.80/gallon, that is about $2.52 per week or approximately $131 per year."
    },
    {
      question: "Do generators use more propane in cold weather?",
      answer: "Yes, for two reasons. First, your heating load increases, pushing the generator to higher load percentages and consuming more fuel per hour. Second, in extreme cold (below 0°F), propane may not vaporize efficiently in smaller tanks, potentially requiring a tank heater. Winter consumption can be 20–50% higher than summer."
    },
    {
      question: "What size propane tank do I need for a whole-house generator?",
      answer: "For a 20–22kW generator: 250-gallon minimum for 3-day backup, 500-gallon for 7-day backup. In hurricane-prone or storm-heavy areas, a 500-gallon or 1,000-gallon tank provides the safety margin you need when propane deliveries may be delayed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use my BBQ propane tanks with a standby generator?",
      answer: "No. Standby generators connect to large stationary propane tanks (100+ gallons) via a permanent gas line. Some portable dual-fuel generators can connect to standard 20-pound BBQ tanks via a hose adapter, but these small tanks only last 5–10 hours and are meant for temporary emergency use."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know when my propane tank needs refilling?",
      answer: "Most propane tanks have a percentage gauge on top that shows the fill level. Schedule a refill when the gauge reads 20–25%. Many propane companies offer automatic delivery programs that monitor your usage and schedule refills before you run low. During storm season, keep your tank above 50% as a precaution."
