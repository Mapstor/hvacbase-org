# Generator Cost Per kWh: Diesel, Propane, Natural Gas, Gasoline (2026)

Running a generator on natural gas costs $0.05–$0.15 per kWh, making it the cheapest fuel option in 2026. Gasoline is the most expensive at $0.15–$0.30 per kWh, with propane ($0.12–$0.25/kWh) and diesel ($0.12–$0.22/kWh) falling in between.

These costs matter more than you might think. During a 72-hour power outage, fuel costs alone can range from $40 on natural gas to over $300 on gasoline — and that is for a modest 10kW load. Choosing the right fuel type can save you hundreds of dollars per outage event and thousands over the generator's lifetime.

<TableOfContents />

## How Generator Cost Per kWh Is Calculated

The formula for calculating your generator's cost per kWh is straightforward, but most online sources get it wrong because they ignore generator efficiency.

**Cost per kWh = Fuel Price per Unit ÷ (Fuel Energy Content × Generator Efficiency)**

Here are the variables you need for each fuel type:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Fuel Energy Content and Typical Generator Efficiency"
  headers={["Fuel", "Energy Content", "Typical Generator Efficiency", "Usable Energy per Unit"]}
  rows={[
    ["Gasoline", "33.7 kWh/gallon (120,238 BTU)", "20–30% (avg 25%)", "6.7–10.1 kWh/gallon"],
    ["Propane (LP)", "26.8 kWh/gallon (91,500 BTU)", "20–28% (avg 24%)", "5.4–7.5 kWh/gallon"],
    ["Natural Gas", "29.3 kWh/therm (100,000 BTU)", "20–30% (avg 25%)", "5.9–8.8 kWh/therm"],
    ["Diesel", "37.95 kWh/gallon (138,490 BTU)", "25–35% (avg 30%)", "9.5–13.3 kWh/gallon"],
  ]}
/>

Generator efficiency is the critical variable. A generator rated at 10kW does not convert 100% of fuel energy into electricity. Small portable generators typically operate at 20–25% thermal efficiency, while large diesel standby units can reach 30–35%. The rest is lost as heat, noise, and exhaust.

<Callout type="info">
Generator efficiency drops at partial loads. A 20kW generator running a 5kW load (25% capacity) operates far less efficiently than the same generator at 15kW (75% capacity). The sweet spot for fuel efficiency is 50–80% of rated capacity.
</Callout>

## 2026 Cost Per kWh by Fuel Type

Using current average fuel prices across the United States in early 2026, here is exactly what each fuel costs per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Generator Cost Per kWh — 2026 U.S. Average"
  headers={["Fuel Type", "Avg Price/Unit (2026)", "kWh per Unit*", "Cost per kWh", "Cost for 10kWh", "Cost for 72-hr Outage (10kW avg)"]}
  rows={[
    ["Gasoline", "$3.20/gallon", "8.4 kWh/gal", "$0.22–$0.30", "$2.20–$3.00", "$158–$216"],
    ["Propane (LP)", "$2.80/gallon", "6.4 kWh/gal", "$0.15–$0.25", "$1.50–$2.50", "$108–$180"],
    ["Natural Gas", "$1.20/therm", "7.3 kWh/therm", "$0.06–$0.12", "$0.60–$1.20", "$43–$86"],
    ["Diesel", "$3.80/gallon", "11.4 kWh/gal", "$0.14–$0.22", "$1.40–$2.20", "$101–$158"],
  ]}
/>

*kWh per unit assumes average generator efficiency for that fuel type.

### Natural Gas: The Clear Winner

At $0.06–$0.12 per kWh, natural gas costs roughly 50–70% less than gasoline to produce the same amount of electricity. If your home has a natural gas connection, a NG standby generator is almost always the most economical choice over time.

Natural gas also has a unique advantage: the supply is continuous. You never need to refuel or schedule deliveries. The gas utility remains pressurized during power outages in the vast majority of situations.

The downside is that natural gas generators produce roughly 10% less power than the same generator running on propane, due to lower energy density.

### Diesel: Best Efficiency, Mid-Range Cost

Diesel generators are the most fuel-efficient, converting 25–35% of fuel energy to electricity compared to 20–30% for gasoline. This efficiency advantage partially offsets diesel's higher per-gallon price.

At $0.14–$0.22 per kWh, diesel is significantly cheaper than gasoline and competitive with propane. Diesel generators also have longer service lives — 20,000–30,000 hours vs. 10,000–15,000 for gas engines.

### Propane: Best Balance

Propane lands in the middle at $0.15–$0.25 per kWh. It stores indefinitely (unlike gasoline), burns cleaner, and is available in bulk deliveries. A 500-gallon tank costs $1,400–$2,000 to fill and provides 150–300+ hours of runtime depending on generator load.

Propane is the most popular fuel for standby generators in areas without natural gas service.

### Gasoline: Most Expensive, Most Common

At $0.22–$0.30 per kWh, gasoline is the most expensive generator fuel. It is also the most accessible for portable generators and the easiest to find — except during widespread outages when gas stations lose power.

Gas prices fluctuate seasonally and spike during severe weather events, exactly when you need your generator most. During Hurricane Ian in 2022, gas prices in parts of Florida exceeded $5/gallon.

## Cost Comparison: Real-World Outage Scenarios

Let's run the numbers for three common outage scenarios using 2026 average fuel prices.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Fuel Cost by Outage Scenario"
  headers={["Scenario", "Gasoline", "Propane", "Natural Gas", "Diesel"]}
  rows={[
    ["4-hour outage, 5kW avg load (20 kWh)", "$4.40–$6.00", "$3.00–$5.00", "$1.20–$2.40", "$2.80–$4.40"],
    ["24-hour outage, 7.5kW avg load (180 kWh)", "$39.60–$54.00", "$27.00–$45.00", "$10.80–$21.60", "$25.20–$39.60"],
    ["72-hour outage, 10kW avg load (720 kWh)", "$158–$216", "$108–$180", "$43–$86", "$101–$158"],
    ["7-day outage, 10kW avg load (1,680 kWh)", "$370–$504", "$252–$420", "$101–$202", "$235–$370"],
    ["30-day outage, 8kW avg load (5,760 kWh)", "$1,267–$1,728", "$864–$1,440", "$346–$691", "$806–$1,267"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Texas Winter Storm:**
During the February 2021 Texas power crisis, many homes lost power for 3–5 days. A homeowner running a 10kW gasoline portable generator for 96 hours (4 days) at an average 7kW load burned approximately 80 gallons of gasoline. At $3.50/gallon (winter Texas prices), that cost roughly $280 in fuel alone. The same outage on natural gas would have cost approximately $50–$70.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Hurricane Season Prep (Florida):**
A homeowner in Tampa runs a 22kW propane standby generator with a 500-gallon tank. During a 72-hour outage at ~12kW average load, the generator consumes roughly 135 gallons of propane. At $2.80/gallon, that is $378 for three days of whole-home power. With natural gas, the same electricity would cost approximately $65.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Weekly Testing Cost:**
Most standby generators run a 30-minute test weekly. A 20kW natural gas standby generator at 50% load during testing uses about 1.5 therms per test. At $1.20/therm, that is $1.80/week or about $94/year in fuel for testing alone. On propane, the same weekly test costs roughly $3.50/week or $182/year.
</Callout>

## How Load Affects Cost Per kWh

Generator fuel consumption is not linear with load. Running at 25% capacity is disproportionately wasteful.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Fuel Consumption vs. Load (10kW Gasoline Generator)"
  headers={["Load %", "Power Output", "Fuel Use (gal/hr)", "Cost/kWh at $3.20/gal", "Efficiency"]}
  rows={[
    ["25%", "2.5 kW", "0.5 gal/hr", "$0.64", "15%"],
    ["50%", "5.0 kW", "0.75 gal/hr", "$0.48", "20%"],
    ["75%", "7.5 kW", "1.0 gal/hr", "$0.43", "22%"],
    ["100%", "10.0 kW", "1.3 gal/hr", "$0.42", "23%"],
  ]}
/>

At 25% load, you pay $0.64 per kWh — three times more than at full load. This is why properly sizing your generator is critical. An oversized generator sitting at 25% load all day will burn significantly more fuel than a right-sized unit at 60–75% load.

<Callout type="warning">
An oversized generator doesn't just waste fuel — it can also "wet stack." This happens when a diesel or propane generator runs at low load for extended periods, causing unburned fuel to build up in the exhaust system. Wet stacking reduces performance and can cause permanent damage.
</Callout>

## Generator Electricity vs. Grid Electricity

How does generator electricity compare to the power you normally get from the utility?

<ComparisonTable
  title="Generator kWh Cost vs. Grid Electricity (2026)"
  headers={["Source", "Cost per kWh", "Compared to Grid Average"]}
  rows={[
    ["U.S. Grid Average", "$0.16/kWh", "Baseline"],
    ["Natural Gas Generator", "$0.06–$0.12/kWh", "25–75% of grid"],
    ["Diesel Generator", "$0.14–$0.22/kWh", "88–138% of grid"],
    ["Propane Generator", "$0.15–$0.25/kWh", "94–156% of grid"],
    ["Gasoline Generator", "$0.22–$0.30/kWh", "138–188% of grid"],
    ["Solar + Battery (amortized)", "$0.08–$0.15/kWh", "50–94% of grid"],
  ]}
/>

Natural gas generators actually produce electricity cheaper than the average grid rate in many regions. This means during extended outages, you are spending less on fuel than you would have on your electric bill for the same usage.

Gasoline and propane generators cost significantly more than grid power, reinforcing the fact that they are emergency-only power sources, not grid replacements.

## Tips to Reduce Generator Running Costs

You can cut your fuel costs by 20–40% with smart practices.

**Right-size your generator.** Running a 22kW generator to power a 5kW load wastes 30–50% more fuel than a 10kW unit at the same load. Load management modules let a smaller generator handle large homes by cycling appliances.

**Maintain optimal load.** Keep your generator running between 50–80% of rated capacity. Turn off unnecessary loads and stagger high-draw appliances.

**Use a programmable thermostat.** During outages, set your AC to 78°F and heat to 65°F. Each degree of AC adjustment saves roughly 3% on generator fuel.

**Insulate and seal.** A well-insulated home retains temperature longer, meaning your HVAC runs less and your generator burns less fuel.

**Maintain your generator.** Dirty air filters, old spark plugs, and low oil levels all reduce efficiency. A well-maintained generator uses 5–10% less fuel than a neglected one.

**Consider dual-fuel.** Dual-fuel generators (gasoline/propane) let you switch to propane for lower per-kWh costs when gasoline prices spike.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is it cheaper to run a generator or pay for grid electricity?",
      answer: "In most cases, grid electricity is cheaper. The U.S. average grid rate is about $0.16/kWh. Natural gas generators can beat this at $0.06–$0.12/kWh, but gasoline generators cost $0.22–$0.30/kWh — nearly double the grid rate. Generators are for backup, not daily power."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to run a generator for 24 hours?",
      answer: "At a 7.5kW average load for 24 hours (180 kWh): gasoline costs $40–$54, propane costs $27–$45, natural gas costs $11–$22, and diesel costs $25–$40. Actual costs depend on your local fuel prices and generator efficiency."
    },
    {
      question: "Which fuel type gives the most runtime per dollar?",
      answer: "Natural gas gives the most runtime per dollar. At $1.20 per therm and 7.3 kWh per therm, you get about 6 kWh per dollar. Gasoline at $3.20/gallon and 8.4 kWh/gallon gives about 2.6 kWh per dollar — less than half the value."
    },
    {
      question: "Does generator size affect cost per kWh?",
      answer: "Yes, significantly. Larger generators are more fuel-efficient at equivalent percentage loads. A 22kW standby generator running at 75% load is more efficient than a 5kW portable at 100% load. However, running any generator at low load (below 30%) dramatically increases your cost per kWh."
    },
    {
      question: "How much propane does a generator use per hour?",
      answer: "A typical home standby generator burns 2–4 gallons of propane per hour at full load. At 50% load, consumption drops to 1–2 gallons per hour. A 22kW generator at half load uses approximately 1.7 gallons/hour, costing about $4.76/hour at $2.80/gallon."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do generators cost more per kWh at low loads?",
      answer: "Generators consume a base amount of fuel just to keep running, regardless of electrical output. At 25% load, much of the fuel energy goes to overcoming internal friction and maintaining RPM rather than producing electricity. This makes the per-kWh cost 2–3x higher at 25% load vs. 75% load."
    },
    {
      question: "Is dual-fuel cheaper to run?",
      answer: "Dual-fuel generators (gasoline/propane) let you switch to whichever fuel is cheaper at the time. Propane is typically 20–30% cheaper per kWh than gasoline. The flexibility to switch fuels is the main advantage — you can use whichever is available and affordable."
    },
    {
      question: "How do generator fuel costs compare to solar battery backup?",
      answer: "Solar battery systems like the Tesla Powerwall have an amortized cost of roughly $0.08–$0.15/kWh over their 10–15 year warranty period. This is cheaper than gasoline, diesel, and propane generators, and comparable to natural gas. However, battery capacity is limited (13.5 kWh per Powerwall), while generators can run indefinitely with fuel."
    },
    {
      question: "Does altitude affect generator fuel costs?",
      answer: "Yes. Generators lose approximately 3.5% of their power output per 1,000 feet of elevation above sea level due to thinner air. At 5,000 feet, a generator produces roughly 17% less power, which effectively increases your cost per kWh by the same percentage. Some generators have high-altitude jet kits to partially compensate."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does weekly generator testing cost in fuel?",
      answer: "Weekly 30-minute test runs cost roughly $1.50–$2.00 per test on natural gas (about $80–$100/year), $3.00–$4.50 per test on propane ($156–$234/year), and $2.50–$3.50 per test on gasoline ($130–$182/year). This is a small but real ongoing cost of standby generator ownership."
