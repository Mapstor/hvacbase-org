## Detailed Reviews

### 1. Generac Guardian 24kW — Best Overall

The Generac Guardian 24kW is the sweet spot for whole-home backup in 2026. With 24kW on propane (21.5kW on natural gas), it handles homes up to 3,500 square feet with central AC, and even larger homes with smart load management.

**What makes it the top pick:** Generac's Mobile Link Wi-Fi monitoring lets you check generator status, run history, and maintenance alerts from your phone. The 200-amp Smart Switch with integrated load management eliminates the need for add-on modules. And Generac's dealer network is the largest in the industry, so finding parts and service is easy.

**Fuel consumption:** At 50% load on natural gas, the 24kW Guardian uses approximately 240 CFH, costing about $2.88/hour at $1.20/therm. On propane, consumption is roughly 2.2 gallons/hour at 50% load ($6.16/hour).

**Noise:** 67 dB at 23 feet is about the same as a running dishwasher. Not silent, but not intrusive for most setback distances.

**Who it is for:** Homeowners with 2,500–3,500 sq ft homes who want reliable, full-home backup including central AC, without the premium price of Kohler.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Install — Denver Suburb:** A 3,200 sq ft home with a 3.5-ton AC unit, gas furnace, and standard appliances. The Generac Guardian 24kW on natural gas was installed for $13,200 total (unit $5,800, ATS $900, gas line $1,200, electrical $2,800, pad + permits $2,500). The system powers the entire home including AC, with load management cycling the water heater and dryer.

### 2. Kohler 20RESCL — Best Premium Build

Kohler builds generators the way they build engines — overbuilt. The 20RESCL uses a purpose-built Kohler Command PRO engine (not a repurposed small engine), heavier-gauge steel enclosure, and corrosion-resistant coating. The result is noticeably quieter operation and longer service intervals.

**Standout features:** The RDT (Remote Digital Transfer) switch provides clean, fast switching with advanced diagnostics. Kohler's OnCue Plus monitoring system is comparable to Generac's Mobile Link. The enclosure is quieter than most competitors at 65 dB.

**The premium factor:** Kohler units cost roughly 15–20% more than comparable Generac models. You are paying for build quality, a quieter enclosure, and arguably better engineering. Whether that premium is worth it depends on your budget and how close the generator sits to living spaces.

**Who it is for:** Homeowners who prioritize quiet operation, premium construction, and are willing to pay extra for it. Particularly good for installations near bedrooms or patios.

### 3. Cummins RS20A — Best Value 20kW

Cummins is the world's largest independent engine manufacturer, and their residential generators benefit from that expertise. The RS20A delivers 20kW on propane with a robust, quiet-running engine at a price that undercuts both Generac and Kohler in the 20kW class.

**Standout features:** The Cummins RS20A features a PowerCommand controller with real-time monitoring. The enclosure design is compact — important if you have tight setback constraints. Cummins offers a 5-year comprehensive warranty.

**Fuel efficiency:** Cummins engines are known for diesel efficiency, and their residential gas engines carry over some of that engineering. The RS20A is competitive with Kohler on fuel consumption and slightly better than Generac at equivalent loads.

**Who it is for:** Value-conscious buyers who want a solid 20kW unit without paying the Kohler premium. Great choice for homes up to 2,500 sq ft with central AC.

### 4. Generac Guardian 22kW — Best for Mid-Size Homes

The 22kW Guardian is Generac's most popular model and the best-selling home standby generator in the United States. It covers most 2,000–3,000 sq ft homes comfortably and benefits from the same Wi-Fi monitoring and Smart Switch technology as the 24kW.

The 22kW sits in the pricing sweet spot — $500–$1,000 less than the 24kW with only a slight power reduction. If your load calculation lands between 18kW and 22kW, this is the smart buy.

### 5. Briggs & Stratton 26kW — Best Warranty

Briggs & Stratton offers a standout 10-year limited warranty on their residential standby generators — double what Generac and Kohler provide at standard. The 26kW model delivers serious power for large homes and heavy loads.

The 26kW output is among the highest in the air-cooled residential class. Fuel consumption is proportionally higher (roughly 260 CFH on NG at 50% load), but if you need the power, it is there.

**Who it is for:** Large homes (3,000–4,000 sq ft) with high electrical loads who value long-term warranty coverage.

### 6. Generac Guardian 16kW — Best for Smaller Homes

At $4,200–$5,000 for the unit and $8,500–$12,000 installed, the 16kW Guardian is the most affordable whole-house option that can still handle central AC in smaller homes. It powers a 2-ton AC system, refrigerator, well pump, and essential circuits simultaneously.

With Generac's Smart Management Modules, a 16kW can handle homes that might normally need 22kW by cycling heavy loads. This is the budget-conscious smart buy.

**Who it is for:** Homes under 2,000 sq ft, or larger homes willing to use load management to avoid stepping up to a 22kW unit.

### 7. Kohler 14RESA — Best Compact Premium

The smallest whole-house option from Kohler, the 14RESA delivers 14kW on propane (12kW on NG) in a compact enclosure. It shares Kohler's premium build quality and quiet operation (65 dB) at a lower entry price than their 20kW model.

**Who it is for:** Smaller homes (under 1,500 sq ft) or essential-circuit-only backup for larger homes. Great for tight installation spaces.

### 8. Generac Protector 30kW — Best for Large/Luxury Homes

When you need serious power — think 4,000+ sq ft homes with multiple AC zones, EV chargers, and pool equipment — the Protector 30kW is liquid-cooled and built for sustained heavy loads. Liquid-cooled engines run quieter, last longer, and maintain more consistent output than air-cooled units.

**Who it is for:** Large homes, small commercial properties, or homeowners who want to power everything without compromise. Budget: $15,000–$20,000 installed.

## Key Features to Compare

### Transfer Switch Technology

The automatic transfer switch (ATS) is as important as the generator itself. It determines how quickly you get power and how intelligently your loads are managed.

    ["Generac Guardian 16/22/24kW", "67 dB", "Running dishwasher"],
    ["Briggs & Stratton 26kW", "69 dB", "Between dishwasher and vacuum"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip">
If noise matters to you (generator near a bedroom, patio, or close neighbor), Kohler and Cummins are worth the extra cost. A 2 dB difference is barely perceptible, but 5 dB feels about twice as loud to the human ear. If your municipality has a 65 dB noise limit at the property line, verify compliance at your actual setback distance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "What is the most reliable standby generator brand?",
      answer: "Generac, Kohler, and Cummins are all highly reliable. Generac has the largest market share (~75%) and dealer network, which means easier service and parts. Kohler is widely regarded as having the best build quality. Cummins leverages their industrial engine expertise. Consumer reliability data shows all three brands have similar failure rates when properly maintained."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a standby generator last?",
      answer: "Air-cooled standby generators (Generac Guardian, Kohler RESA, Cummins RS) typically last 10,000–15,000 running hours. Liquid-cooled models (Generac Protector, Kohler large commercial) can last 20,000–30,000 hours. With typical home backup usage (100–500 hours/year), an air-cooled unit lasts 20–30+ years. The transfer switch and controller often outlast the engine."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Kohler worth the extra cost over Generac?",
      answer: "For most homeowners, Generac offers better value. Kohler is worth the premium if you prioritize quiet operation (especially with a generator near living spaces), premium construction, or if you prefer Kohler's dealer experience. The actual performance difference is small — both brands produce reliable, code-compliant power."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I install a standby generator myself?",
      answer: "We strongly advise against it. Installation involves working with gas lines, high-voltage electrical connections, and compliance with NEC/NFPA codes. Most jurisdictions require licensed electricians and gas fitters. DIY installation will also void most manufacturer warranties and may violate your home insurance policy."
    },
    {
      question: "How far from the house does a standby generator need to be?",
      answer: "NFPA 37 and local codes typically require a minimum of 18 inches from the house wall, 5 feet from any opening (windows, doors, vents), and 3 feet of clearance on accessible sides. Some municipalities require 5–10 feet from property lines. Always verify with your local building department."
    },
    {
      question: "Do standby generators increase home value?",
      answer: "According to consumer data and real estate assessments, a standby generator can increase home value by 3–5%, or roughly $5,000–$15,000 depending on the home and market. The value increase is highest in areas with frequent power outages (hurricane zones, rural areas) and for higher-end homes."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to maintain a standby generator annually?",
      answer: "Annual maintenance costs range from $200 to $400 for a professional service visit, which includes oil change, filter replacements, spark plug inspection, battery check, and operational testing. Adding weekly exercise fuel cost (about $60–$180/year depending on fuel type), total annual upkeep runs $260–$580."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I get a natural gas or propane standby generator?",
      answer: "If your home has a natural gas connection, choose natural gas. It is cheaper to run ($0.06–$0.12/kWh vs. $0.15–$0.25/kWh for propane), never runs out, and requires no tank installation or refills. If you do not have natural gas, propane is the standard choice with indefinite fuel shelf life and on-site storage."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the generator is too small for my home?",
      answer: "An undersized generator will overload and shut down via its built-in circuit breaker when demand exceeds capacity. Repeated overloading can damage the generator's alternator and engine. If your load is close to the generator's limit, load management modules can cycle non-essential circuits to prevent overload."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly does a standby generator start when the power goes out?",
      answer: "Most standby generators detect a power outage within 5–10 seconds and start delivering power within 10–30 seconds total. The automatic transfer switch handles the entire process without any action from you. Some sensitive electronics may momentarily lose power during the 10–30 second transfer gap — a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) bridges this gap for critical devices."
