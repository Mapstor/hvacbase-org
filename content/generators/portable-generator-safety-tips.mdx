# Portable Generator Safety: CO Poisoning Prevention Guide

Carbon monoxide from portable generators kills approximately 70 people every year in the United States and sends over 900 to the emergency room with CO poisoning. The single most important safety rule: never operate a portable generator indoors, in a garage, or within 20 feet of any window, door, or vent — even with the door open.

Every year after hurricanes, ice storms, and other outage events, the death toll from generator CO poisoning rivals or exceeds the storm deaths themselves. Every one of these deaths is preventable. This guide covers everything you need to know to use a portable generator safely, with emphasis on the carbon monoxide risks that account for the majority of generator-related fatalities.

<TableOfContents />

## Carbon Monoxide: The Silent Killer

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion in gasoline, diesel, and propane engines. You cannot see it, smell it, or taste it. At dangerous concentrations, CO causes confusion and drowsiness within minutes — which means victims often lose the ability to save themselves before realizing something is wrong.

### How CO Poisoning Happens

A running portable generator produces CO at concentrations 100 times higher than automobile exhaust. In an enclosed or semi-enclosed space, CO levels can reach lethal concentrations in as little as 5 minutes.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Carbon Monoxide Exposure Effects"
  headers={["CO Level (ppm)", "Time to Symptoms", "Symptoms", "Outcome"]}
  rows={[
    ["35 ppm", "6–8 hours", "Mild headache", "OSHA 8-hour exposure limit"],
    ["100 ppm", "1–2 hours", "Headache, dizziness", "Seek fresh air immediately"],
    ["200 ppm", "30–60 minutes", "Severe headache, confusion, nausea", "Life-threatening without treatment"],
    ["400 ppm", "15–30 minutes", "Intense headache, collapse, unconsciousness", "Fatal within 2–3 hours"],
    ["800 ppm", "5–15 minutes", "Rapid onset of symptoms, seizures", "Fatal within 1 hour"],
    ["1,600 ppm", "2–5 minutes", "Unconsciousness", "Fatal within 20 minutes"],
    ["6,400+ ppm", "1–2 minutes", "Immediate collapse", "Fatal within minutes"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
**A generator in a closed garage produces 6,000–10,000+ ppm of CO within minutes.** This is an immediately lethal concentration. Opening the garage door does NOT make it safe — CO still accumulates to dangerous levels in a partially open garage. Always operate generators completely outdoors, at least 20 feet from any opening.
</Callout>

### The Data on Generator CO Deaths

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) tracks generator-related CO deaths and incidents meticulously. The data paints a clear and tragic picture.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Generator CO Poisoning Statistics"
  headers={["Statistic", "Figure", "Source"]}
  rows={[
    ["Average annual CO deaths from generators", "~70 per year", "CPSC"],
    ["Average annual ER visits from generator CO", "~900 per year", "CPSC"],
    ["Percentage occurring during power outages", "~85%", "CPSC"],
    ["Most common location: inside home", "~40%", "CPSC"],
    ["Most common location: garage (door open or closed)", "~30%", "CPSC"],
    ["Most common location: basement/crawl space", "~10%", "CPSC"],
    ["Deaths occurring while sleeping", "~50%", "CDC"],
    ["Incidents involving CO alarm", "< 20%", "CPSC"],
    ["Highest risk period after storm events", "First 24–48 hours", "CDC"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Incident — Hurricane Aftermath (Florida):**
After Hurricane Ian in 2022, seven people in Florida died from CO poisoning within 72 hours of the storm passing — all from portable generators run indoors or in enclosed garages. In several cases, families went to bed with the generator running in an attached garage, believing the open garage door provided sufficient ventilation. CO seeped under the door into the home during the night.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Incident — Ice Storm (Texas):**
During the February 2021 Texas winter storm, at least 11 people died from generator CO poisoning. Many victims were trying to heat their homes by running generators in living rooms, kitchens, or attached garages. Temperatures below 10°F made the outdoors seem like an impossible option for generator placement, leading to lethal decisions.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Incident — Basement Generator (Northeast):**
A family in New Jersey ran a portable generator in their basement during a winter outage. Despite opening a basement window, CO filled the basement and seeped up through the floor. All four family members required emergency hospitalization; two suffered permanent neurological damage. The basement window provided insufficient ventilation for the CO output.
</Callout>

## The 20-Foot Rule

The CPSC, CDC, NFPA, and every major safety organization agree on the core placement rule:

**Place the generator at least 20 feet from any window, door, or vent, with the exhaust pointing away from the house.**

<ComparisonTable
  title="Generator Placement Rules"
  headers={["Location", "Safe?", "Why"]}
  rows={[
    ["Outside, 20+ feet from house", "✅ Yes", "CO disperses safely in open air"],
    ["Outside, 10–20 feet from house", "⚠️ Risky", "CO can drift into open windows"],
    ["Outside, under 10 feet from house", "❌ Dangerous", "CO levels at windows/doors can be lethal"],
    ["Open garage (door fully up)", "❌ No", "CO accumulates even with door open"],
    ["Partially open garage", "❌ No", "Extremely dangerous — near-enclosed space"],
    ["Closed garage", "❌ Absolutely not", "Lethal within minutes"],
    ["Inside the house (any room)", "❌ Absolutely not", "Lethal within minutes"],
    ["Basement or crawl space", "❌ Absolutely not", "CO fills space and seeps into home"],
    ["Covered porch or breezeway", "⚠️ Risky", "Semi-enclosed — CO can accumulate"],
    ["Carport (open-sided)", "⚠️ Risky", "Only if truly open on multiple sides, 20+ ft from openings"],
  ]}
/>

### Exhaust Direction Matters

Point the generator's exhaust away from the house and any windows. CO is slightly lighter than air and tends to drift with wind currents. If the exhaust points toward a window that happens to be cracked open — even on the second floor — CO can enter the home.

### Wind Changes Direction

What is safe at 6 PM may not be safe at 2 AM when the wind shifts. Position your generator so that no reasonable wind direction pushes exhaust toward your home's openings.

## CO Detectors: Your Last Line of Defense

Every home using a portable generator should have working carbon monoxide detectors on every level of the home, especially near bedrooms. CO detectors are your last line of defense if CO enters the home despite proper generator placement.

<ComparisonTable
  title="CO Detector Requirements and Recommendations"
  headers={["Recommendation", "Details"]}
  rows={[
    ["Minimum: one per floor", "Required by law in most states"],
    ["Near bedrooms", "Within 15 feet of each sleeping area"],
    ["Near garage wall (inside home)", "Detects CO from attached garages"],
    ["Battery backup required", "Hardwired detectors must have battery backup"],
    ["Test monthly", "Press test button to verify alarm function"],
    ["Replace every 5–7 years", "Sensors degrade over time"],
    ["If alarm sounds", "Get everyone outside immediately, call 911"],
    ["Digital display models", "Show CO levels in real time — worth the extra $10–$20"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="important">
**If your CO alarm goes off while a generator is running:**
1. Get everyone out of the house immediately — do not stop to investigate.
2. Call 911 from outside.
3. Do not re-enter until emergency responders clear the home.
4. Move the generator further away and reposition the exhaust.
5. Ventilate the home thoroughly before re-entering.

CO symptoms — headache, dizziness, confusion — may make you unable to save yourself if you delay. Act first. Investigate later.
</Callout>

## CO Shutdown Technology (UL 2201)

Starting in 2020, the UL 2201 standard introduced mandatory CO safety shutoff technology for portable generators. Generators meeting this standard have built-in CO sensors that automatically shut down the engine if CO levels become dangerous.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Generator CO Safety Technology by Brand"
  headers={["Brand", "Technology Name", "How It Works", "Models"]}
  rows={[
    ["Generac", "CO Guard", "Dual CO sensors shut down engine at dangerous levels", "Most portable models since 2022"],
    ["Champion", "CO Shield", "Built-in CO sensor with automatic shutoff", "Most portable models since 2022"],
    ["Westinghouse", "CO Sensor", "Automatic shutoff with CO detection", "iGen and WGen series"],
    ["Yamaha", "CO Minder", "Engine shutoff when CO is detected", "EF2200iS and newer"],
    ["Honda", "CO-MINDER", "Continuous CO monitoring with auto shutoff", "EU2200i Companion and newer"],
    ["Ryobi", "CO Detect", "Auto shutoff technology", "Select portable models"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**When buying a new portable generator, insist on UL 2201 compliance with CO shutoff technology.** Several states (including Maryland, Oregon, and New Jersey) now require CO shutoff on all new portable generators sold. This technology has prevented hundreds of CO poisoning incidents since its introduction. It is not a substitute for proper placement, but it provides a critical safety backup.
</Callout>

## Electrical Safety

Carbon monoxide is not the only generator hazard. Electrical dangers — electrocution, back-feeding, and fire — account for additional injuries and deaths each year.

### Back-Feeding Prevention

Back-feeding occurs when generator power flows backward through your electrical panel into the utility power lines. This can electrocute utility workers repairing downed lines and can cause fires when the utility power is restored.

**Never plug a generator directly into a wall outlet.** This is called "male-to-male" or "suicide cord" connection and is illegal, dangerous, and potentially fatal.

The safe alternatives are running individual extension cords from the generator to each appliance, or installing a manual transfer switch that physically disconnects your home from the utility before connecting to the generator. A transfer switch costs $200–$500 installed and is the only safe way to power hardwired circuits (furnace, well pump, sump pump).

<Callout type="warning">
**"Suicide cords" (male-to-male plugs) kill utility workers.** If you plug a generator into a wall outlet with a male-to-male cord, generator power backfeeds through your panel and into the power lines at up to 7,200 volts (after transformer step-up). Line workers assume dead lines are safe. This practice is illegal in all 50 states and can result in criminal charges if a worker is injured.
</Callout>

### Extension Cord Safety

Using the wrong extension cords causes overheating and fire.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Extension Cord Requirements for Generators"
  headers={["Amperage of Load", "Minimum Wire Gauge", "Maximum Length", "Cord Rating"]}
  rows={[
    ["Up to 10A (1,200W)", "16 AWG", "100 ft", "Light duty"],
    ["10–15A (1,200–1,800W)", "14 AWG", "50 ft", "Medium duty"],
    ["15–20A (1,800–2,400W)", "12 AWG", "50 ft", "Heavy duty"],
    ["20–30A (2,400–3,600W)", "10 AWG", "50 ft", "Extra heavy duty"],
  ]}
/>

Use outdoor-rated extension cords only (marked "W" in the cord type designation). Keep cords out of standing water. Never run cords under rugs or through closed windows/doors where insulation can be damaged and create a fire hazard.

### Grounding

Most portable generators are grounded through their frame (the frame acts as the grounding electrode). If your generator has a separate grounding terminal, drive a copper grounding rod (at least 4 feet deep) and connect it to the generator with a grounding wire.

Generators connected through a transfer switch are grounded through your home's existing grounding system.

## Fuel Safety

Gasoline is extremely flammable and produces explosive vapors.

**Never refuel a running generator.** Spilled gasoline on a hot engine ignites instantly. Shut the generator off and let it cool for at least 5 minutes before refueling. Fuel vapors from the gas can ignite on hot exhaust components.

**Store gasoline properly.** Use only UL-listed or ASTM-approved fuel containers. Store away from the generator, the house, and any ignition source. Never store gasoline indoors. Maximum residential storage is typically 25 gallons (check local fire codes).

**Use fuel stabilizer.** Add STA-BIL or similar stabilizer at every fill-up to prevent fuel degradation and carburetor clogging.

**Never store fuel near the generator while it is running.** A generator fire near stored fuel containers can cause an explosion. Keep fuel storage at least 10 feet from the running generator.

## Weather Protection

Generators cannot run in direct rain, but you still need power during storms. Here is how to protect your generator from weather while maintaining safe ventilation.

**Generator canopy tents** are specifically designed to cover a generator while leaving all sides open for ventilation and exhaust. These cost $50–$150 and are the safest rain protection option.

**Never enclose a generator** in a structure without massive ventilation. A plywood box, a closed shed, or a tarp draped to the ground traps CO and can be lethal. Any rain cover must leave the sides fully open.

**Elevate the generator** on a dry surface (plywood, concrete blocks) to prevent standing water from reaching electrical outlets or the engine.

**Dry your hands** before touching the generator, cords, or outlets. Water + electricity = electrocution risk.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I run a generator in my garage with the door open?",
      answer: "No. This is one of the most dangerous misconceptions. CPSC data shows that roughly 30% of generator CO deaths occur in garages, including garages with the door open. CO accumulates in the garage and seeps into the home through walls, doors, and shared HVAC systems. Always operate generators completely outdoors, at least 20 feet from any opening."
    },
    {
      question: "How far from the house should a portable generator be?",
      answer: "At least 20 feet from any window, door, vent, or other opening. Point the exhaust away from the house. The CPSC, CDC, and NFPA all specify 20 feet as the minimum safe distance. In practice, further is always better."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a CO detector if my generator is outside?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. Wind shifts, unexpected exhaust patterns, and nearby structures can redirect CO toward your home even with proper placement. CO detectors ($20–$50 each) are your critical backup safety layer. Install on every level of your home and near all sleeping areas. They are required by law in most states."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the symptoms of CO poisoning?",
      answer: "Early symptoms include headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, and confusion. These can be mistaken for the flu or fatigue. As CO levels increase, victims experience disorientation, loss of consciousness, and death. CO poisoning during sleep is particularly dangerous because victims never wake up. If you suspect CO exposure, get to fresh air immediately and call 911."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a suicide cord and why is it dangerous?",
      answer: "A suicide cord (also called a backfeed cord or male-to-male cord) has male prongs on both ends and is used to plug a generator directly into a wall outlet. This backfeeds power into your home's wiring and out to the utility grid at potentially lethal voltages. It can electrocute utility line workers, cause house fires, and damage your appliances when utility power is restored. It is illegal in all 50 states."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I run a generator in the rain?",
      answer: "Not in direct rain without protection. Water in the electrical outlets or engine can cause electrocution or damage. Use a generator canopy tent ($50–$150) that covers the top while leaving all sides open for ventilation. Never use a tarp that touches the ground on all sides — this traps CO. Operate on a dry, elevated surface."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I wait to refuel a generator?",
      answer: "Shut off the generator and wait at least 5 minutes for the engine and exhaust to cool before refueling. Gasoline vapors can ignite on contact with hot engine components or exhaust surfaces. Even a small spill on a hot engine can cause a flash fire. Never refuel while the generator is running."
    },
    {
      question: "Are new generators safer than old ones?",
      answer: "Yes, significantly. Generators manufactured since 2020 increasingly include CO shutoff technology (UL 2201 standard) that automatically shuts down the engine if CO levels become dangerous. Some also have enclosed inverter designs that reduce CO emissions by up to 90%. If your generator is more than 5 years old and lacks CO detection, consider upgrading."
    },
    {
      question: "Can CO from a generator travel upstairs?",
      answer: "Yes. CO mixes with air and follows air currents throughout a home. It can travel through floor gaps, HVAC ducts, stairwells, and shared wall cavities. CO from a generator in an attached garage can reach second-floor bedrooms. This is why CO detectors are needed on every level of the home, not just the ground floor."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if someone has CO poisoning from a generator?",
      answer: "Get everyone out of the home immediately — do not stop to turn off the generator. Call 911. Move to fresh air. If the victim is unconscious, perform CPR if trained. Do not re-enter the home until emergency responders have ventilated the space and confirmed it is safe. CO poisoning requires emergency medical treatment — even seemingly mild cases can cause lasting neurological damage."
