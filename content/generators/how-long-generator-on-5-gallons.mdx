# How Long Will a Generator Run on 5 Gallons of Gas?

A typical portable generator runs 6–12 hours on 5 gallons of gasoline at 50% load. The exact runtime depends on the generator size, load level, and engine efficiency. A small 2,000W inverter generator stretches 5 gallons to roughly 20+ hours at 25% load, while a large 10,000W conventional generator burns through 5 gallons in about 4 hours at 75% load.

Here is the complete runtime chart for every common generator size, followed by fuel-saving strategies that can extend your 5 gallons by 30–50%.

<Callout type="info">
**Inverter vs. Conventional:** Inverter generators use significantly less fuel than conventional generators at the same wattage because their engines adjust speed based on load. A 2,200W inverter at 25% load sips fuel at 0.12 gal/hr, while a 3,500W conventional generator at 25% load still burns 0.30 gal/hr — even though both are producing similar wattage.
</Callout>

## How to Calculate Runtime for Any Generator

The formula is simple:

**Runtime (hours) = Fuel Tank Size (gallons) ÷ Fuel Consumption Rate (gallons per hour)**

The key variable is fuel consumption rate, which depends on the generator's load. Most manufacturers publish fuel consumption at 25%, 50%, and 100% load in their spec sheets.

If you only know the fuel consumption at 50% load (the most commonly published figure), you can estimate other loads. At 25% load, fuel consumption is roughly 55–65% of the 50% load rate. At 75% load, consumption is roughly 130–140% of the 50% rate. At 100% load, consumption is roughly 160–175% of the 50% rate.

<Callout type="example">
**Example Calculation — Honda EU2200i:**
The Honda EU2200i has a 0.95-gallon tank and consumes 0.12 gal/hr at 25% load (eco-throttle mode). With 5 gallons of gas: 5 ÷ 0.12 = **41.7 hours of runtime** at 25% load. At 50% load (0.24 gal/hr): 5 ÷ 0.24 = **20.8 hours.** That is enough to keep a fridge and lights running for almost an entire day on 5 gallons.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example Calculation — Champion 7500W:**
The Champion 7500W consumes about 0.80 gal/hr at 50% load. With 5 gallons: 5 ÷ 0.80 = **6.25 hours at 50% load.** At 25% load: approximately 0.50 gal/hr, giving 5 ÷ 0.50 = **10 hours.** Running a fridge, freezer, and some lights at 25% load stretches your fuel much further.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example Calculation — Large 10,000W Portable:**
At 50% load, a typical 10,000W generator burns about 1.10 gal/hr. With 5 gallons: 5 ÷ 1.10 = **4.5 hours.** That is barely one evening. At this consumption rate, you need 26+ gallons for a 24-hour outage — more than four 5-gallon gas cans.
</Callout>

## Runtime for Other Fuel Quantities

You might not have exactly 5 gallons. Here is the runtime for common fuel amounts using a 5,500W generator at 50% load (0.60 gal/hr).

## How Much Gas to Store for Emergencies

How much gasoline you should keep on hand depends on how long you expect outages to last and what load you plan to run.

  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
Gasoline has a shelf life of 3–6 months without stabilizer. Store fuel in approved containers (UL-listed fuel cans), in a cool, ventilated area, away from the house and any ignition sources. Add fuel stabilizer (STA-BIL or similar) at every fill and rotate your supply every 3–6 months. Never store more than 25 gallons of gasoline at a residential property — check your local fire code for exact limits.

## 7 Ways to Make 5 Gallons Last Longer

### 1. Run at the Lowest Load Possible

Cut unnecessary loads. Do you really need the TV, the toaster, and every light in the house? Every 100W you eliminate saves fuel. A 7,500W generator at 25% load uses 37% less fuel per hour than at 50% load.

### 2. Use an Inverter Generator

If you are buying new, an inverter generator's variable-speed engine burns dramatically less fuel at low loads. At 25% load, a 2,200W inverter uses 0.12 gal/hr vs. 0.30 gal/hr for a 3,500W conventional — running 2.5x longer on the same fuel.

### 3. Cycle Appliances Instead of Running Everything at Once

Run the refrigerator for 1 hour, then turn it off for 2 hours (a well-sealed fridge stays cold for 4–6 hours with the door closed). Run the sump pump on demand, not continuously. This lets you operate at a lower average load.

### 4. Pre-Cool Your Home Before the Outage

If a storm is forecasted, set your AC to 68–70°F before the power goes out. Your home will stay comfortable for hours without running the AC, saving the most fuel-hungry appliance for later.

### 5. Switch to LED Lights

If you haven't already, LED bulbs use 80% less electricity than incandescent. Lighting your entire home with LEDs adds only 50–100W of load vs. 500–1,000W with old bulbs.

### 6. Keep the Generator Well-Maintained

A clean air filter, fresh oil, and new spark plugs improve combustion efficiency by 5–10%. A dirty air filter alone can increase fuel consumption by 10–15%.

### 7. Use Propane Instead of Gasoline

If you have a dual-fuel generator, propane burns at a slightly lower rate for the energy produced and is available in pre-filled tanks without needing a gas station. Twenty-pound BBQ tanks are available at most hardware stores even during outages.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Fuel Savings Example:**
A homeowner in Louisiana used a Champion 5,500W generator during a 24-hour outage. At first, they ran everything at once (50% load = 0.60 gal/hr = 14.4 gallons/day). After cycling appliances and cutting unnecessary loads, they reduced average load to 25% (0.40 gal/hr = 9.6 gallons/day). Fuel savings: **4.8 gallons in 24 hours**, or about $15.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How long will a 5500 watt generator run on 5 gallons of gas?",
      answer: "A 5,500W generator runs approximately 8.3 hours on 5 gallons at 50% load (2,750W), and about 12.5 hours at 25% load (1,375W). At full load, runtime drops to about 5.5–6 hours. The exact time depends on the specific model's fuel efficiency."
    },
    {
      question: "How long will a 3500 watt generator run on 5 gallons of gas?",
      answer: "A 3,500W conventional generator runs approximately 11 hours on 5 gallons at 50% load. At 25% load, runtime extends to roughly 17 hours. A 3,500W inverter generator will run even longer — approximately 16 hours at 50% load thanks to its variable-speed engine."
    },
    {
      question: "How long will a 7500 watt generator run on 5 gallons of gas?",
      answer: "A 7,500W generator runs approximately 6.3 hours on 5 gallons at 50% load. At 25% load, runtime improves to about 10 hours. At full 7,500W load, 5 gallons lasts only 3.5–4 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "How many gallons of gas does a generator use per hour?",
      answer: "It varies by size: a 2,200W inverter uses 0.12–0.24 gal/hr, a 5,500W conventional uses 0.40–0.85 gal/hr, and a 10,000W conventional uses 0.70–1.45 gal/hr. The range depends on load level. Most generators are most efficient at 50–75% load."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it better to run a generator on half tank or full tank?",
      answer: "There is no efficiency difference between a full tank and a half tank — fuel consumption per hour stays the same. However, avoid letting the tank run completely dry, as this can draw sediment into the fuel line and carburetor. Refuel when the tank reaches about 25% to maintain consistent operation."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I make my generator more fuel efficient?",
      answer: "Yes. Keep it well-maintained (clean air filter, fresh oil, new spark plugs). Run it at 50–75% load instead of 25% or 100%. Reduce your electrical load by cycling appliances. Use an inverter generator, which adjusts engine speed to match load. These steps combined can improve fuel efficiency by 20–40%."
    },
    {
      question: "How much gas should I store for emergencies?",
      answer: "For a 5,500W generator at 50% load: store 5 gallons for an 8-hour outage, 15 gallons for a 24-hour outage, and 45 gallons for a 72-hour outage. Use approved fuel containers, add stabilizer, store away from the home, and rotate every 3–6 months. Check local fire codes for maximum storage limits (usually 25 gallons residential)."
    },
    {
      question: "Does ethanol-free gas make a generator run longer?",
      answer: "Slightly. Ethanol-free gasoline has about 3% more energy per gallon than E10 (10% ethanol blend), so runtime improves marginally. The bigger benefit is longevity: ethanol attracts moisture and degrades faster, causing carburetor issues. Ethanol-free fuel stores longer and causes fewer maintenance problems. It costs more ($0.50–$1.00/gallon premium) but is worth it for generators."
    },
    {
      question: "How long will 5 gallons of propane last in a generator?",
      answer: "A 20-pound propane tank holds about 4.7 gallons. On a 3,500W dual-fuel generator at 50% load, propane burns at roughly 0.5 gal/hr, giving about 9.4 hours per tank. Propane has less energy per gallon than gasoline, so runtime per gallon is shorter, but propane stores indefinitely and burns cleaner."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I turn my generator off at night?",
      answer: "If you can safely do so, yes — turning the generator off at night saves fuel. A well-insulated house stays warm (or cool) for several hours without HVAC. A closed refrigerator stays cold for 4–6 hours. Turning off the generator for 6–8 hours overnight saves 3–8 gallons depending on your generator size. Restart in the morning to power essentials."
