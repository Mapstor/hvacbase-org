# How Much Does It Cost to Run a Generator on Natural Gas? (2026)

Running a natural gas generator costs $0.50–$3.50 per hour depending on the generator size and load, making it the cheapest fuel option for standby power. A typical 20kW home standby generator at 50% load costs roughly $1.50–$2.00 per hour to run on natural gas in 2026, or about $36–$48 per day.

Natural gas generators have a massive cost advantage over gasoline and propane because the fuel itself is cheap ($1.00–$1.60 per therm nationally) and the supply is continuous — you never need to refuel, schedule deliveries, or worry about running dry during a multi-day outage.

## Natural Gas Consumption by Generator Size

Generator manufacturers publish fuel consumption rates in cubic feet per hour (CFH) at various load levels. Here is what the most popular home standby generators actually consume.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Natural Gas Consumption by Generator Size and Load"
  headers={["Generator Size", "25% Load (CFH)", "50% Load (CFH)", "75% Load (CFH)", "100% Load (CFH)"]}
  rows={[
    ["8kW", "65 CFH", "95 CFH", "130 CFH", "165 CFH"],
    ["10kW", "75 CFH", "115 CFH", "155 CFH", "195 CFH"],
    ["14kW", "100 CFH", "150 CFH", "200 CFH", "250 CFH"],
    ["16kW", "110 CFH", "170 CFH", "230 CFH", "290 CFH"],
    ["20kW", "130 CFH", "200 CFH", "275 CFH", "350 CFH"],
    ["22kW", "145 CFH", "225 CFH", "305 CFH", "385 CFH"],
    ["24kW", "155 CFH", "240 CFH", "330 CFH", "420 CFH"],
    ["26kW", "165 CFH", "260 CFH", "355 CFH", "450 CFH"],
    ["30kW", "190 CFH", "300 CFH", "410 CFH", "520 CFH"],
    ["38kW", "235 CFH", "375 CFH", "510 CFH", "650 CFH"],
    ["48kW", "290 CFH", "460 CFH", "635 CFH", "810 CFH"],
  ]}
/>

To convert CFH to cost: divide CFH by 100 to get CCF per hour, then multiply by your price per CCF (roughly the same as price per therm).

**Example:** A 20kW generator at 50% load uses 200 CFH. That is 2.0 CCF per hour. At $1.20 per CCF, your cost is **$2.40 per hour**.

## Hourly Running Costs by Generator Size

Here is the cost breakdown you came for — exact hourly costs at 2026 natural gas prices.

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Northeast Winter Storm:**
A homeowner in Connecticut with a 22kW Generac runs their generator for 4 days during an ice storm. At 50% average load and a local gas rate of $1.50/therm: 225 CFH × 96 hours = 21,600 CF = 216 therms. Cost: 216 × $1.50 = **$324 for 4 days of whole-home power.** The same outage on a gasoline portable would cost $500–$700.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Texas Summer Heat:**
A homeowner in Houston with a 20kW standby runs their AC-heavy load for 3 days during a grid stress event. At 65% average load and a Texas gas rate of $0.90/therm: 240 CFH × 72 hours = 17,280 CF = 172.8 therms. Cost: 172.8 × $0.90 = **$155.52 for 3 days.** That works out to $2.16/hour or about $51.84/day.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Real-World Example — Weekly Exercise/Testing Cost:**
A 20kW standby generator runs its automatic weekly exercise cycle for 30 minutes at approximately 50% load. Consumption: 200 CFH × 0.5 hours = 100 CF = 1.0 therm. At $1.20/therm, each weekly test costs **$1.20.** Annual testing cost: roughly **$62.40** — far cheaper than propane or gasoline testing.

Over 10 years, a natural gas generator saves approximately $4,600–$5,400 in fuel costs compared to propane or gasoline. That savings alone can cover a significant portion of the generator installation cost.

## How Natural Gas Supply Works During Outages

A common concern is whether natural gas remains available when the power goes out. The answer is almost always yes.

Natural gas distribution systems use pressure in the pipeline to push gas to your home. This pressure is maintained by compressor stations that have their own backup power. Gas distribution lines are buried underground, protecting them from wind, ice, and falling trees — the main causes of electric outages.

There are rare exceptions. Direct damage to a gas main from earthquakes, flooding, or construction accidents can interrupt supply. Some utilities may also shut off gas as a safety precaution during major natural disasters.

In over 95% of power outage scenarios, your natural gas supply will continue without interruption.

<Callout type="warning">
While natural gas supply is highly reliable during outages, it is not 100% guaranteed. If you live in an earthquake-prone area or a flood zone, consider having a backup propane tank as a secondary fuel source. Some generators offer dual-fuel (NG/LP) capability.
</Callout>

## Gas Line Sizing for Generators

Your existing natural gas line may not have enough capacity to supply a large generator on top of your furnace, water heater, stove, and dryer. Generators require significant gas flow.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Natural Gas Line Requirements by Generator Size"
  headers={["Generator Size", "Required Gas Flow (CFH)", "Minimum Line Size (from meter)", "Typical Run Length"]}
  rows={[
    ["8–10kW", "150–200 CFH", "¾\" pipe", "Up to 50 ft"],
    ["14–16kW", "250–300 CFH", "1\" pipe", "Up to 50 ft"],
    ["20–22kW", "350–400 CFH", "1\" pipe (short) or 1¼\" pipe", "Up to 75 ft"],
    ["24–26kW", "420–450 CFH", "1¼\" pipe", "Up to 75 ft"],
    ["30–38kW", "520–650 CFH", "1¼\" or 1½\" pipe", "Up to 100 ft"],
    ["48kW", "810 CFH", "1½\" or 2\" pipe", "Up to 100 ft"],
  ]}
/>

If your gas meter is far from the generator pad, or if you have many gas appliances already on the line, you may need a gas line upgrade. This typically costs $500–$2,000 and includes a new dedicated line from the meter to the generator.

Your installer should perform a gas line sizing calculation (per NFPA 54 / International Fuel Gas Code) before installation to ensure adequate supply.

## Tips for Reducing Natural Gas Generator Costs

Even though natural gas is already the cheapest fuel, you can reduce costs further.

**Use load management.** Smart load-shedding modules cycle high-draw appliances so your generator runs at a consistent 50–70% load instead of spiking to 100%. This improves fuel efficiency and reduces hourly costs.

**Set realistic thermostat targets.** During an outage, set heat to 66°F and AC to 78°F. Each degree adjustment saves roughly 3% in fuel consumption for the HVAC load.

**Turn off non-essential circuits.** Pool pumps, hot tubs, EV chargers, and electric dryers are luxuries during an outage. Turning them off can reduce your load by 30–50%.

**Negotiate your gas rate.** If you have a choice of natural gas suppliers (available in deregulated states like Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania), shop for a lower per-therm rate. Even $0.10/therm savings translates to meaningful cost reductions during extended outages.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How much natural gas does a 22kW generator use per hour?",
      answer: "A 22kW generator uses approximately 145 CFH at 25% load, 225 CFH at 50% load, 305 CFH at 75% load, and 385 CFH at full load. At 50% load with a $1.20/therm gas rate, this costs about $2.70/hour."
    },
    {
      question: "Is natural gas cheaper than propane for generators?",
      answer: "Yes, significantly. Natural gas costs roughly $0.06–$0.12 per kWh of generator output, while propane costs $0.15–$0.25 per kWh. Over a 72-hour outage with a 20kW generator, natural gas saves approximately $200–$350 compared to propane."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to run a natural gas generator for a week?",
      answer: "A 20kW natural gas generator at 50% load costs approximately $400/week at the national average rate of $1.20/therm. A smaller 14kW unit at the same load costs about $302/week. In low-cost regions like Texas ($0.90/therm), costs drop to roughly $250–$300/week for a 20kW unit."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my gas bill spike from running a generator?",
      answer: "Yes, your gas bill will increase noticeably. A 20kW generator at 50% load for 72 hours consumes approximately 144 therms, adding roughly $173 to your gas bill at $1.20/therm. However, this is much cheaper than buying gasoline ($400+) or propane ($350+) for the same period."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my existing gas line handle a generator?",
      answer: "It depends on your gas meter capacity, line size, and existing gas appliances. Generators under 14kW often work with existing ¾\" or 1\" gas lines. Larger generators (20kW+) frequently need a dedicated 1\" or 1¼\" gas line. Your installer should perform a sizing calculation per NFPA 54 before installation."
    },
    {
      question: "Does a natural gas generator lose power compared to propane?",
      answer: "Yes — a natural gas generator typically produces about 10% less rated power than the same unit running on propane. This is because natural gas has lower energy density (100,000 BTU/therm vs 91,500 BTU/gallon for LP, but LP is denser in practice). A generator rated at 22kW on propane may produce only 20kW on natural gas. Factor this into your sizing calculation."
    },
    {
      question: "How often do natural gas lines fail during storms?",
      answer: "Very rarely. Natural gas pipelines are buried underground and are not affected by wind, ice, or falling trees. Supply interruptions during power outages occur in fewer than 5% of events, usually due to direct physical damage from earthquakes, floods, or construction accidents. For most homeowners, the gas line is far more reliable than the electrical grid."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my natural gas generator if gas pressure drops?",
      answer: "Most quality standby generators have a low-pressure fuel shutoff that safely shuts down the generator if gas pressure drops below the minimum threshold (typically 3.5–5 inches of water column). This prevents damage to the engine. The generator will automatically restart when pressure is restored."
    },
    {
      question: "Does natural gas generator exhaust smell?",
      answer: "Natural gas burns very cleanly, so exhaust from a NG generator has minimal odor compared to gasoline or diesel. You will notice some exhaust warmth and a faint combustion smell near the unit, but it dissipates quickly. Natural gas generators produce significantly less carbon monoxide and particulates than gasoline models, though they should still never run indoors."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get a tax credit for installing a natural gas generator?",
      answer: "As of 2026, there is no federal tax credit specifically for natural gas generators. However, some states offer rebates or credits for home backup power systems, especially if they include clean energy components. Check with your state energy office and local utility for current incentive programs. Solar battery backup systems do qualify for the federal solar investment tax credit (ITC)."
