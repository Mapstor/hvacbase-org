# Solar Panel Cost by State: 2026 Pricing Guide

The average cost of a residential solar panel system in the U.S. is **$2.60–$3.50 per watt** before incentives in 2026, which translates to **$16,900–$22,750 for a standard 6.5 kW system**. After the 30% federal tax credit, that drops to **$11,830–$15,925**. However, prices vary by as much as 40% between states — a system in Arizona costs 25–30% less than the same system in New York or Massachusetts.

Below you'll find comprehensive pricing data for all 50 states, including local incentives, payback periods, and our assessment of solar ROI in each market.

| Delaware | $2.85 | $22,800 | $15,960 | SRECs, Green Energy Fund | 14.5 | 9.5 |
| D.C. | $3.20 | $25,600 | $17,920 | SRECs ($350+/MWh), high electric rates | 15.5 | 5.5 |

<Callout type="info">
**Washington, D.C. has the highest SREC values in the nation** at $350–$400 per MWh (megawatt-hour). For an 8 kW system producing ~10 MWh/year, that's $3,500–$4,000 in annual SREC income on top of electricity savings, driving D.C.'s exceptional payback period despite high installation costs.
</Callout>

## What Drives Solar Costs by State?

The same 8 kW system can cost $19,200 in Arizona but $25,600 in Massachusetts. Here's why:

### Labor Costs

Labor accounts for 20–30% of total installation cost. States with higher prevailing wages (California, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut) have proportionally higher solar costs. Unionized markets can add $0.20–$0.40/W.

### Permitting and Interconnection

Permitting costs range from $200 (streamlined online permits in Arizona, California) to $2,000+ (multi-department reviews in some northeastern jurisdictions). Some states have adopted SolarAPP+ (an automated online permitting platform) which speeds approvals and reduces costs.

### Installer Competition

Markets with many installers (California, Texas, Florida, Arizona) tend to have lower per-watt pricing due to competition. Less competitive markets (rural states, newer solar markets) have fewer options and higher prices.

### Supply Chain and Logistics

Panels and equipment ship from ports and distribution centers concentrated in coastal states. Inland and remote installations face higher freight costs. Alaska and Hawaii have the highest logistics costs.

### Electricity Rate

Paradoxically, states with higher electricity rates (California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York) attract more solar installers, which drives competition and can moderate installation costs — while simultaneously improving payback period.

## State-Level Incentives: The Big Differentiators

### Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs)

SRECs are tradeable certificates generated by your solar system. States with SREC markets effectively pay you for every MWh your system produces:

| State | SREC Value (per MWh) | Annual Income (8 kW system) |
|---|---|---|
| Washington, D.C. | $350–$400 | $3,500–$4,000 |
| New Jersey | $150–$200 (TRECs) | $1,500–$2,000 |
| Massachusetts | $200–$275 | $1,800–$2,500 |
| Pennsylvania | $30–$45 | $300–$450 |
| Maryland | $60–$80 | $600–$800 |
| Ohio | $15–$25 | $150–$250 |
| Illinois | Performance-based | $1,000–$2,000 (upfront) |

### State Tax Credits

| State | Tax Credit | Max Amount |
|---|---|---|
| New York | 25% of system cost | $5,000 |
| South Carolina | 25% of system cost | $3,500 |
| Hawaii | 35% of system cost | $5,000 |
| Arizona | 25% of system cost | $1,000 |
| Iowa | 15% of system cost | $5,000 |

<Callout type="example">
**Real example: New York homeowner.** 8 kW system at $3.15/W = $25,200. Federal ITC (30%) = -$7,560. NY state tax credit (25%, max $5,000) = -$5,000. NY-Sun incentive = -$1,600. **Net cost: $11,040.** At $22 ¢/kWh, annual savings of ~$2,100. **Payback: 5.3 years.** This makes New York one of the best solar ROI states in the nation despite above-average installation costs.
</Callout>

### Property and Sales Tax Exemptions

Most states exempt solar installations from property tax assessments (your home value increases but your property taxes don't). Many also exempt solar equipment from state sales tax. These exemptions typically save $1,000–$3,000 combined on an 8 kW system.

## Real-World Cost Examples

### Example 1: Budget-Conscious in Texas

- **System:** 7.5 kW, 18 × 415W panels, string inverter
- **Gross cost:** $18,750 ($2.50/W)
- **Federal ITC:** -$5,625
- **Net cost:** $13,125
- **Annual production:** 11,500 kWh
- **Annual savings:** $1,495 (at $0.13/kWh)
- **Payback:** 8.8 years

Texas's competitive installer market and lack of permitting complexity keeps costs down, though the absence of state incentives means you're relying entirely on the federal credit.

### Example 2: Maximizing ROI in Massachusetts

- **System:** 8.5 kW, 21 × 405W panels, Enphase microinverters
- **Gross cost:** $27,200 ($3.20/W)
- **Federal ITC:** -$8,160
- **SMART program income:** ~$1,200/year for 10 years
- **State sales tax exemption:** -$1,700
- **Net cost (Year 1):** $17,340
- **Annual savings + SMART:** $3,700
- **Payback:** 4.7 years

Massachusetts's combination of high electricity rates ($0.275/kWh), the SMART program, and strong net metering creates one of the best solar markets in the country.

### Example 3: Sunny but Cheap Power in Idaho

- **System:** 8 kW, 20 × 400W panels, string inverter
- **Gross cost:** $21,200 ($2.65/W)
- **Federal ITC:** -$6,360
- **Net cost:** $14,840
- **Annual production:** 12,000 kWh
- **Annual savings:** $1,260 (at $0.105/kWh)
- **Payback:** 11.8 years

Idaho has great sun but rock-bottom electricity rates from hydropower. Solar makes environmental sense but the financial case is weaker without state incentives.

### Example 4: Overcoming Low Sun in Vermont

- **System:** 9 kW, 22 × 410W panels, microinverters
- **Gross cost:** $28,350 ($3.15/W)
- **Federal ITC:** -$8,505
- **Vermont state incentive:** -$1,800
- **Net cost:** $18,045
- **Annual production:** 9,500 kWh
- **Annual savings:** $1,900 (at $0.20/kWh)
- **Payback:** 9.5 years

Vermont's lower sun hours are offset by progressive energy policies and above-average electricity rates.

## Solar Cost Trends: Where Prices Are Headed

Panel costs have declined approximately 70% since 2014. However, the rate of decline has slowed, and total system costs (which include labor, permitting, and soft costs) are declining at a slower pace than hardware alone.

| Year | Average Cost/Watt (Before ITC) | Average 8 kW System Cost |
|---|---|---|
| 2018 | $3.50 | $28,000 |
| 2020 | $3.10 | $24,800 |
| 2022 | $3.00 | $24,000 |
| 2024 | $2.85 | $22,800 |
| 2026 | $2.95 | $23,600 |

<Callout type="info">
**Why did costs tick up slightly in 2026–2026?** Tariff adjustments on imported panels (primarily from Southeast Asian manufacturing), increased demand straining installer capacity, and rising labor costs. However, the higher-efficiency panels available today (400–440W vs 350–380W a few years ago) mean you need fewer panels per system, partially offsetting the per-watt increase.
</Callout>

## How to Get the Best Price in Your State

**Get at least 3 quotes.** Pricing varies 20–30% between installers for the same system. Use platforms like EnergySage, which provides competitive quotes from pre-vetted installers.

**Consider local installers over national brands.** Large national companies (Sunrun, SunPower/Maxeon, Tesla) often charge $0.30–$0.60/W more than local and regional installers for comparable equipment. Local installers also tend to provide more responsive customer service.

**Don't pay for premium panels unless you need them.** If you have ample roof space, mid-range 400–415W panels offer the best value. Premium 440W+ panels are worth it only when roof space is constrained.

**Time your purchase strategically.** Q4 (October–December) is often the slowest season for solar installers. You may find better pricing and faster installation during fall and winter months.

**Stack every available incentive.** Federal ITC + state tax credit + SRECs + utility rebates + sales/property tax exemptions can reduce your out-of-pocket cost by 40–60% in the best states.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What is the average cost of solar panels in 2026?",
    answer: "The national average is $2.95 per watt before incentives, or about $23,600 for an 8 kW system. After the 30% federal tax credit, the average drops to $16,520. With additional state incentives, many homeowners pay $10,000–$17,000 out of pocket. Costs range from $2.40/W in Arizona to $3.20/W in Massachusetts and D.C."
  },
  {
    question: "Which state has the cheapest solar panels?",
    answer: "Arizona has the lowest installation costs at approximately $2.40 per watt ($19,200 for an 8 kW system before incentives). Texas ($2.50/W), Nevada ($2.45/W), and Florida ($2.50/W) are also among the cheapest. However, cheapest installation cost doesn't always equal best value — states with high electricity rates and strong incentives (Massachusetts, New York, California) often have better ROI despite higher upfront costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the 30% solar tax credit still available in 2026?",
    answer: "Yes. The Inflation Reduction Act extended the 30% Investment Tax Credit through 2032. It will step down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034. The credit applies to the total installed cost of solar panels and battery storage, including equipment, labor, permitting, and related electrical work. There is no cap on the credit amount for residential installations."
  },
  {
    question: "What state incentives are available for solar?",
    answer: "State incentives vary widely. Common ones include state tax credits (NY: 25%, SC: 25%, HI: 35%), SREC programs (D.C., NJ, MA, PA, MD, OH), utility rebates, property tax exemptions, and sales tax exemptions. Check the DSIRE database (dsireusa.org) for current incentives in your state. Some incentives change annually, so verify before purchasing."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take for solar panels to pay for themselves?",
    answer: "The national average payback period is 8.5 years. The fastest payback is in Hawaii (4.5 years), California (5.5 years), and Massachusetts/New York (6 years). The slowest is in states with low electricity rates and few incentives like Idaho (12.5 years) and North Dakota (13 years). After the payback period, all electricity savings are pure profit for the remaining 15–20+ years of panel life."
  },
  {
    question: "Do solar panels increase home value?",
    answer: "Yes. Studies by Zillow and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab found that solar panels increase home value by approximately $4 per watt installed — about $32,000 for an 8 kW system. Homes with solar also sell 20% faster on average. In most states, this added value is exempt from property tax assessments."
  },
  {
    question: "Is solar worth it in cloudy states like Washington or Oregon?",
    answer: "Solar can still work in cloudy states, but payback periods are longer (10–15 years). Washington's low electricity rates ($0.11/kWh) and lower sun hours mean ROI is among the weakest in the nation. Oregon fares slightly better with state rebates. In these states, solar is more of an environmental choice than a financial one, though rising electricity rates may improve the math over time."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I lease or buy solar panels?",
    answer: "Buying (with cash or a solar loan) provides the best long-term value because you own the system, receive the tax credit, and keep all electricity savings. Leasing or PPA (power purchase agreement) requires no upfront cost but typically saves only 10–30% on electricity versus 50–80% with ownership. Leased systems also don't qualify for the federal tax credit for the homeowner — the leasing company claims it."
  },
  {
    question: "How much do solar panels save per month?",
    answer: "Monthly savings depend on your system size, electricity rate, and sun exposure. The national average is $100–$175/month for an 8 kW system. In high-rate states like California ($0.30+/kWh), savings can reach $200–$300/month. In low-rate states like Idaho ($0.105/kWh), expect $80–$120/month. These savings increase 2–4% annually as electricity rates rise."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best time of year to install solar panels?",
    answer: "Fall and winter (October–February) typically offer the best pricing and fastest installation timelines because demand is lower. However, panels installed in spring or summer start generating savings sooner, which can offset any seasonal pricing differences. The most important factor is locking in current incentive levels rather than timing the market for seasonal discounts."
