# Evaporative Cooler vs AC: Which Should You Choose?

If you live in a dry climate (below 50% summer humidity), an evaporative cooler will cool your home for **75–80% less electricity** than air conditioning — saving $600–$1,000+ per cooling season. If your humidity regularly exceeds 50%, skip the swamp cooler entirely and go with AC; evaporative cooling simply doesn't work in humid air.

That's the fundamental split. But the full picture involves upfront costs, maintenance, water usage, installation complexity, air quality, and comfort preferences. This guide lays out every factor with real numbers so you can make the right call for your home and climate.

<TableOfContents />

## The Core Difference: How Each Technology Works

These two systems cool your home through completely different physical processes, and understanding that difference explains everything about when each one shines (or fails).

### Evaporative Cooling (Swamp Cooler)

An evaporative cooler pulls hot outdoor air through water-soaked pads. As the water evaporates, it absorbs heat energy from the air, lowering its temperature. The cooled, now-humidified air flows into your home, and stale indoor air exits through open windows or vents.

**Key physics:** Evaporation only happens efficiently when there's a big gap between the current humidity and full saturation. Dry air = lots of evaporation = significant cooling. Humid air = little evaporation = barely any cooling.

### Air Conditioning (Refrigerant Cycle)

An air conditioner uses a compressor to circulate refrigerant through a closed loop. The refrigerant absorbs heat from indoor air at the evaporator coil, carries it outside, and releases it at the condenser coil. This process also removes moisture from the air as a byproduct, lowering indoor humidity.

**Key physics:** The refrigerant cycle works regardless of outdoor humidity. Whether it's 10% or 90% relative humidity outside, an AC system produces cold, dehumidified air.

<Callout type="info">
**The fundamental trade-off:** Evaporative coolers add moisture to your air; air conditioners remove it. This single fact determines which system works in your climate. In arid regions, the added humidity from a swamp cooler is actually a comfort benefit. In already-humid regions, it makes things worse.

## Head-to-Head Comparison: Every Factor That Matters

### Energy Consumption & Operating Costs

This is where evaporative coolers dominate — and it's not even close.

| Metric | Evaporative Cooler (3,500 CFM) | Window AC (8,000 BTU) | Portable AC (12,000 BTU) | Central AC (3-ton) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Wattage** | 150–200 W | 700–900 W | 1,100–1,400 W | 3,000–3,500 W |
| **Hourly electricity cost** | $0.03 | $0.13 | $0.19 | $0.52 |
| **Monthly cost (8 hrs/day)** | $7.20 | $31.20 | $45.60 | $124.80 |
| **Monthly cost (12 hrs/day)** | $10.80 | $46.80 | $68.40 | $187.20 |
| **5-month season cost** | $36–$54 | $156–$234 | $228–$342 | $624–$936 |
| **Water cost (monthly)** | $5–$15 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Total monthly operating** | $12–$26 | $31–$47 | $46–$68 | $125–$187 |

*Based on U.S. average electricity rate of $0.16/kWh and average water rate of $0.005/gallon.*

<Callout type="example">
**Real-world comparison — Phoenix, AZ:** The Hernandez family switched from a 3-ton central AC to a whole-house evaporative cooler for their 1,500 sq ft home. Their May–September electricity bills dropped from an average of $310/month to $55/month (including water costs). Annual savings: approximately $1,275. The cooler paid for itself in its first summer.
</Callout>

### Cooling Performance by Climate

The critical question isn't which system cools better in general — it's which system cools better *where you live*.

| Climate Zone | Avg July RH | Evap Cooler Performance | AC Performance | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Desert (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Palm Springs) | 10–20% | Drops temp 25–40°F | Standard cooling | **Evaporative** — far cheaper, effective |
| Mountain (Denver, SLC, Boise) | 15–30% | Drops temp 20–30°F | Standard cooling | **Evaporative** — great performance, huge savings |
| Great Plains (ABQ, El Paso, Lubbock) | 20–35% | Drops temp 15–25°F | Standard cooling | **Evaporative** — works well most days |
| Transitional (Sacramento, Fresno) | 25–45% | Works most days, struggles some | Consistent cooling | **Hybrid approach** — evap + AC backup |
| Upper Midwest (dry summer days) | 35–55% | Inconsistent; good some days | Consistent cooling | **AC** — evap too unreliable |
| Subtropical (Houston, Atlanta, Miami) | 60–80% | Nearly useless | Dehumidifies + cools | **AC** — no contest |
| Coastal (San Francisco, Seattle) | 50–70% | Poor performance | Effective when needed | **AC** — or just open windows |

### Temperature Achievable: What Can You Realistically Expect?

Evaporative coolers don't have a thermostat in the traditional sense. They cool the air by a fixed amount based on the wet-bulb depression. Here's what different conditions actually produce:

| Outside Temp | Outside RH | Wet-Bulb Temp | Achievable Indoor Temp* | Temp Drop |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 110°F | 10% | 75°F | 78–82°F | 28–32°F |
| 105°F | 15% | 77°F | 79–83°F | 22–26°F |
| 100°F | 20% | 78°F | 80–84°F | 16–20°F |
| 100°F | 30% | 82°F | 84–87°F | 13–16°F |
| 95°F | 25% | 79°F | 81–84°F | 11–14°F |
| 95°F | 40% | 83°F | 85–88°F | 7–10°F |
| 95°F | 50% | 86°F | 87–90°F | 5–8°F |
| 90°F | 35% | 80°F | 82–85°F | 5–8°F |
| 90°F | 50% | 82°F | 84–87°F | 3–6°F |

*Assumes a quality cooler achieving 80–85% wet-bulb efficiency.*

An air conditioner, by contrast, can typically achieve whatever indoor temperature you set — usually 68–76°F — regardless of outdoor conditions. The trade-off is the energy required to get there.

<Callout type="warning">
**The 50% humidity wall:** Notice how the achievable temperature drops off sharply once outdoor humidity passes 40–50%. At 50% RH, even on a 95°F day, your swamp cooler might only get you down to 87°F — barely comfortable. This is why we draw the line at 50% humidity for recommending evaporative cooling.
</Callout>

### Upfront Costs & Installation

| System Type | Equipment Cost | Installation Cost | Total Upfront |
|---|---|---|---|
| Portable evap cooler (small) | $100–$200 | $0 (plug & play) | $100–$200 |
| Portable evap cooler (large) | $300–$500 | $0 (plug & play) | $300–$500 |
| Window-mount evap cooler | $400–$700 | $100–$300 (basic plumbing) | $500–$1,000 |
| Whole-house evap (roof/wall) | $800–$2,000 | $500–$1,500 | $1,300–$3,500 |
| Window AC unit | $150–$400 | $0–$100 | $150–$500 |
| Portable AC | $300–$700 | $0 (plug & vent) | $300–$700 |
| Mini-split AC | $1,500–$4,000 | $1,000–$3,000 | $2,500–$7,000 |
| Central AC | $3,000–$7,000 | $2,000–$5,000 | $5,000–$12,000 |

Portable evaporative coolers offer the lowest barrier to entry. You can have effective cooling for $150–$500 with zero installation. Central AC is the most expensive option upfront but offers the most comprehensive whole-home cooling.

### Maintenance Comparison

| Maintenance Task | Evaporative Cooler | Air Conditioner |
|---|---|---|
| **Pad/filter replacement** | Every 1–5 seasons ($10–$80) | Every 1–3 months ($5–$30) |
| **Cleaning** | Weekly pad check, monthly deep clean | Monthly filter check, annual coil cleaning |
| **Professional service** | Optional — most DIY-friendly | Recommended annually ($100–$200) |
| **Winterization** | Required — drain, remove pads, cover | None needed for most systems |
| **Typical annual maintenance cost** | $30–$100 | $150–$400 |
| **Common failure points** | Pump, pads, water distribution | Compressor, capacitor, refrigerant leaks |
| **Average lifespan** | 10–15 years (window/roof mount) | 12–20 years (central), 8–12 years (window) |
| **DIY repair difficulty** | Easy — simple mechanical parts | Moderate to difficult — refrigerant requires licensed tech |

<Callout type="example">
**Real-world maintenance comparison:** Tom in Albuquerque runs a window-mount evaporative cooler on his 1,200 sq ft home. His annual maintenance consists of replacing aspen pads ($20), a new pump every 3 years ($35), and 30 minutes of spring startup cleaning. Total annual cost: about $35. His neighbor with central AC spends $175/year on professional maintenance plus $60 in filters. Both systems are functioning well after 8 years.

### Air Quality & Comfort

This is an area where AC has a meaningful advantage, and it's often overlooked.

**Air conditioner advantages:**
- Removes humidity, creating a drier, more comfortable feel
- Closed-window operation keeps out dust, pollen, and pollution
- Recirculates filtered indoor air
- Precise temperature control via thermostat
- Consistent comfort regardless of outdoor conditions

**Evaporative cooler advantages:**
- Adds humidity in arid climates (relieves dry skin, nosebleeds, static)
- Constant fresh air circulation — no "stale" recirculated air
- No refrigerant chemicals
- Doesn't create the "overly cold" feeling some people dislike about AC

**Evaporative cooler disadvantages:**
- Requires open windows — you can't seal your home against dust and allergens
- Added humidity can feel clammy if outdoor humidity spikes unexpectedly
- No precise temperature control; you get what the physics give you
- Can introduce outdoor odors (wildfire smoke, traffic, neighboring activities)

<Callout type="info">
**Allergy and asthma note:** If you have respiratory conditions triggered by outdoor allergens, dust, or wildfire smoke, AC is the safer choice. Evaporative coolers constantly draw in outside air. During wildfire season in the West, this can significantly degrade indoor air quality. Some homeowners keep a backup AC window unit for smoke events specifically.
</Callout>

### Environmental Impact

| Factor | Evaporative Cooler | Air Conditioner |
|---|---|---|
| **Electricity use** | 65–400 W | 700–3,500 W |
| **Carbon footprint (electricity)** | Very low | Moderate to high |
| **Refrigerants** | None | HFCs (high GWP) or newer R-32/R-454B |
| **Water consumption** | 3–15 gal/hour | None |
| **Heat island contribution** | Minimal (no heat rejection) | Yes (condenser dumps heat outside) |
| **End-of-life disposal** | Simple — metal and plastic | Requires refrigerant recovery |

In terms of total environmental impact, evaporative coolers win handily in most categories. Their electricity consumption is so low that even accounting for water use, the total environmental footprint is significantly smaller. The one exception: in areas with severe water scarcity, the 1,500–3,000 gallons/month of water consumption is a legitimate concern.

## Total Cost of Ownership: 10-Year Comparison

Let's put it all together with a comprehensive 10-year cost analysis for cooling a 1,200 sq ft home in different climate scenarios.

### Scenario 1: Phoenix, AZ (Ideal for Evaporative)

| Cost Category | Whole-House Evap Cooler | Central AC (14 SEER2) |
|---|---|---|
| **Equipment + installation** | $2,500 | $8,000 |
| **Annual electricity** | $100 | $1,100 |
| **Annual water** | $80 | $0 |
| **Annual maintenance** | $50 | $200 |
| **Pad/filter replacements (annual)** | $25 | $40 |
| **Major repair (year 7 est.)** | $150 | $800 |
| **10-year total** | **$5,200** | **$21,400** |
| **10-year savings with evap** | **$16,200** | — |

### Scenario 2: Denver, CO (Good for Evaporative)

| Cost Category | Whole-House Evap Cooler | Central AC (14 SEER2) |
|---|---|---|
| **Equipment + installation** | $2,500 | $8,000 |
| **Annual electricity** | $65 (shorter season) | $650 |
| **Annual water** | $50 | $0 |
| **Annual maintenance** | $50 | $200 |
| **10-year total** | **$4,350** | **$16,500** |
| **10-year savings with evap** | **$12,150** | — |

### Scenario 3: Houston, TX (Bad for Evaporative)

| Cost Category | Portable Evap Cooler | Window AC (8,000 BTU) |
|---|---|---|
| **Equipment** | $350 | $300 |
| **Annual electricity** | $45 | $250 |
| **Annual water** | $60 | $0 |
| **Annual maintenance** | $30 | $40 |
| **Actual cooling achieved** | Minimal — 3–5°F drop | Full cooling to set temp |
| **Real value** | Near zero — wasted money | Effective cooling |

<Callout type="takeaway">
**The verdict on total cost:** In suitable dry climates, an evaporative cooler saves $12,000–$16,000 over 10 years compared to central AC. Even compared to window AC units, the savings are $3,000–$5,000 over a decade. But in humid climates, buying an evaporative cooler is throwing money away — it won't effectively cool your space.
</Callout>

## The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds

Some homeowners in transitional climates (Sacramento, Fresno, parts of Colorado and New Mexico) use both systems strategically:

**How the hybrid approach works:**
1. **May–June and September:** Use the evaporative cooler exclusively (humidity is typically lower)
2. **July–August hot/dry days:** Evaporative cooler handles it
3. **Monsoon season or humid spikes:** Switch to AC for those specific days
4. **Evening/night:** Often the evaporative cooler alone is sufficient even during humid periods

**Real-world example:** The Patel family in Tucson installed a roof-mount evaporative cooler ($2,200) alongside their existing 2.5-ton central AC. From May through September, they run the swamp cooler about 80% of the time and the AC about 20% (primarily during July monsoon humidity spikes). Their annual cooling cost dropped from $1,400 to about $450 — a 68% reduction.

**Important rule:** Never run both systems simultaneously in the same space. The AC removes moisture while the swamp cooler adds it, creating an energy-wasting tug of war.

## Decision Framework: Which System Is Right for You?

Answer these questions to determine your best path:

**Choose an evaporative cooler if:**
- Your average July relative humidity is below 40% (ideal) or below 50% (workable)
- You live in the Desert Southwest, Mountain West, or Great Plains
- You're comfortable with windows cracked open while cooling
- You want the lowest possible operating costs
- You appreciate fresh air circulation and added humidity in dry climates
- You're handy enough for basic seasonal maintenance

**Choose air conditioning if:**
- Your average July relative humidity exceeds 50%
- You need precise temperature control (68°F exactly, every time)
- You have allergies, asthma, or sensitivity to outdoor air quality
- You want a sealed, quiet indoor environment
- Wildfire smoke is a regular concern in your area
- You're not interested in seasonal maintenance tasks

**Consider a hybrid approach if:**
- You're in a transitional climate zone (25–45% average summer humidity)
- You experience monsoon seasons with temporary humidity spikes
- You already have AC installed and want to reduce costs
- You want maximum comfort flexibility

<Callout type="example">
**Real-world decision example:** Janet in Sacramento, CA was torn between the two systems. Her July humidity averages 35% but spikes to 55% during occasional heat waves. She installed a portable evaporative cooler ($380) as her primary cooling and kept her window AC unit as backup. She runs the swamp cooler about 25 days/month and the AC about 5 days. Her cooling bill dropped from $95/month to about $30/month.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "Is an evaporative cooler cheaper than AC?",
    answer: "Yes, dramatically — but only in dry climates. An evaporative cooler uses 65–400 watts compared to 700–3,500 watts for AC systems. Monthly operating costs run $10–$25 for a swamp cooler vs. $30–$200 for AC. Over a 5-month cooling season, expect to save $500–$900 with an evaporative cooler. Water usage adds $5–$15/month, but it's a fraction of the electricity savings."
  },
  {
    question: "Can an evaporative cooler cool a whole house?",
    answer: "Yes. A properly sized whole-house evaporative cooler (4,000–8,000+ CFM) installed on the roof or in a window can cool an entire home of 1,200–2,500 sq ft. The key is adequate CFM (use the formula: sq ft × ceiling height ÷ 2) and proper exhaust ventilation via open windows or dedicated relief vents on the opposite side of the house."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my swamp cooler stop working some days?",
    answer: "This almost always means humidity spiked above 50%. Evaporative coolers rely on dry air for evaporation. During monsoon season, after rain, or on unusually humid days, the physics simply don't support effective evaporative cooling. Check your local humidity reading — if it's above 50%, the cooler will underperform. This is normal, not a malfunction."
  },
  {
    question: "Do evaporative coolers use a lot of water?",
    answer: "A residential swamp cooler uses 3–15 gallons of water per hour, depending on size. A typical mid-size unit (3,500 CFM) uses about 1,500–2,000 gallons per month. At average U.S. water rates, that's $7–$10/month. While not insignificant, this water cost is dwarfed by the electricity savings compared to AC ($100–$150/month)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is evaporative cooling better for the environment than AC?",
    answer: "In most respects, yes. Evaporative coolers use 75–80% less electricity (reducing carbon emissions from power generation), contain no refrigerant chemicals (which are potent greenhouse gases), and produce less waste heat. The trade-off is water consumption, which matters in drought-prone regions. Overall, their total environmental footprint is significantly smaller than AC."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a swamp cooler in my apartment?",
    answer: "Portable evaporative coolers work in apartments with certain conditions: you need to be able to open windows for exhaust, your local humidity needs to be below 50%, and you should have a way to refill the water tank (or use a unit with a garden hose connection if your apartment has a spigot). Many apartment dwellers in cities like Denver, Phoenix, and Albuquerque use portable swamp coolers very successfully."
  },
  {
    question: "How loud are evaporative coolers compared to AC?",
    answer: "Evaporative coolers typically produce 45–65 dB, roughly equivalent to a conversation or moderate background noise. Most of the sound comes from the fan and water flow. Window and central AC units range from 40–60 dB (indoor) but the outdoor condenser adds 55–75 dB. Both are manageable, but swamp coolers have a constant 'rushing air' quality that some people find more noticeable than the periodic cycling of an AC compressor."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I run my evaporative cooler with windows closed?",
    answer: "Don't do it. Humidity will rapidly build up indoors, potentially reaching 70–80%+ relative humidity. At that point, the cooler becomes completely ineffective and you'll have a damp, clammy, uncomfortable environment. You also risk mold growth on walls, furniture, and in ductwork. Always provide exhaust ventilation — open windows or dedicated relief vents totaling at least 2 sq ft of opening per 1,000 CFM of cooler capacity."
  },
  {
    question: "At what humidity do evaporative coolers stop working?",
    answer: "Evaporative coolers become progressively less effective as humidity rises. At 30% RH, they work great (15–25°F drop). At 40% RH, still useful (10–18°F drop). At 50% RH, marginal (5–10°F drop). Above 55–60% RH, they provide minimal cooling and mostly just blow humid air. The practical cutoff for worthwhile cooling is around 50% relative humidity."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I replace my central AC with an evaporative cooler?",
    answer: "If you live in a dry climate (below 40% average summer humidity), replacing central AC with a whole-house evaporative cooler can save $12,000–$16,000 over 10 years. However, consider keeping a backup AC option for occasional humid days. Many homeowners in transitional climates use a hybrid approach — running the swamp cooler 80% of the time and AC only during humidity spikes — reducing cooling costs by 40–68%."
