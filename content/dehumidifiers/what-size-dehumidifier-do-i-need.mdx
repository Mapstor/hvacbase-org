# What Size Dehumidifier Do I Need? (AHAM Sizing Chart + Calculator)

To size a dehumidifier correctly, you need two numbers: your room's square footage and its moisture severity level. A moderately damp 1,000 sq ft basement needs a 25-pint unit; the same room with visible water seepage needs 45 pints. Use the AHAM sizing chart below or our calculator to get your exact recommendation.

Undersizing is the most common dehumidifier mistake homeowners make — and the most expensive. A unit that's too small runs 24/7, never reaches your target humidity, burns out in 2–3 years instead of 7–10, and costs more in electricity than a properly sized unit.

## The Official AHAM Sizing Chart

AHAM (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers) publishes the industry-standard sizing guidelines. Their chart accounts for room size and four moisture condition levels:

<ComparisonTable
  title="AHAM Dehumidifier Sizing Chart (Pints Per Day)"
  headers={["Room Size (sq ft)", "Moderately Damp (50–60% RH)", "Very Damp (60–70% RH)", "Wet (70–80% RH)", "Extremely Wet (80%+ RH)"]}

These ratings are measured at AHAM standard conditions: 65°F and 60% RH. In real-world conditions — especially in warm, very humid environments — actual moisture removal may be 20–40% higher than the rated capacity.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Determine Your Moisture Condition Level

The moisture condition level is the most important variable. Here's how to assess yours:

### Moderately Damp (50–60% RH)
- Musty smell only during humid weather
- No visible moisture on walls or floors
- Space feels slightly stuffy in summer
- Hygrometer reads 50–60% on humid days

### Very Damp (60–70% RH)
- Musty smell present most of the time
- Damp spots occasionally appear on walls or floors
- Condensation on cold-water pipes
- Hygrometer consistently reads 60–70%

### Wet (70–80% RH)
- Walls or floors feel damp to the touch
- Visible sweating on walls and windows
- Small puddles appear after rain
- Mold spots visible on surfaces
- Hygrometer reads 70–80%

### Extremely Wet (80%+ RH)
- Standing water or consistent flooding
- Active water seepage through walls or floor
- Extensive mold growth on multiple surfaces
- Laundry hung in the space doesn't dry
- Hygrometer reads 80%+ regularly

<Callout type="warning">
If your space is "extremely wet," fix the water source before buying a dehumidifier. No portable dehumidifier can overcome active flooding or continuous water intrusion. Address foundation cracks, improve exterior grading, repair leaking pipes, and install a sump pump first. Then size your dehumidifier for the residual moisture.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Measure Your Room

Calculate the total square footage of the contiguous space you want to dehumidify. For basements, use the entire footprint even if parts are unfinished.

**Standard rooms:** Length × Width = Square footage
**L-shaped rooms:** Break into two rectangles, calculate each, and add them together
**Open floor plans:** Include all connected areas without doors

### Ceiling Height Adjustment

The AHAM chart assumes standard 8-foot ceilings. If your ceilings are taller, you have more air volume to dehumidify. Adjust like this:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Ceiling Height Capacity Adjustment"
  headers={["Ceiling Height", "Adjustment Factor", "Example: 1,000 sq ft room"]}
  rows={[
    ["8 ft (standard)", "1.0× (no adjustment)", "30 pt → 30 pt"],
    ["9 ft", "1.13×", "30 pt → 34 pt"],
    ["10 ft", "1.25×", "30 pt → 38 pt"],
    ["11 ft", "1.38×", "30 pt → 41 pt"],
    ["12 ft", "1.50×", "30 pt → 45 pt"],
    ["14 ft (warehouse)", "1.75×", "30 pt → 53 pt"],
    ["16 ft (commercial)", "2.0×", "30 pt → 60 pt"]
  ]}
/>

## Step 3: Apply Adjustment Factors

Beyond ceiling height, several conditions increase your dehumidification needs:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Additional Sizing Adjustments"
  headers={["Condition", "Add to Capacity", "Why"]}
  rows={[
    ["Space is occupied by 3+ people regularly", "+5 pints", "People exhale 0.5–1 pint of moisture per day"],
    ["Laundry room or dryer vent nearby", "+5 pints", "Dryers exhaust significant moisture"],
    ["Indoor pool or hot tub nearby", "+10–20 pints", "Evaporation is continuous and substantial"],
    ["Kitchen with heavy cooking", "+5 pints", "Boiling, steaming generate moisture"],
    ["Multiple exterior doors opened frequently", "+5 pints", "Infiltration of humid outdoor air"],
    ["Space is below grade (basement)", "+5 pints", "Ground moisture wicks through concrete"],
    ["No vapor barrier on concrete floor", "+5–10 pints", "Slab moisture migration is significant"],
    ["Crawl space with exposed dirt floor", "+10 pints", "Massive evaporation from exposed soil"]
  ]}
/>

### The Complete Sizing Formula

**Required capacity = AHAM chart value × ceiling height factor + adjustment factors**

**Example calculation:**
- Room: 1,500 sq ft basement, 9-ft ceilings
- Condition: Very damp (60–70% RH)
- AHAM chart: 35 pints
- Ceiling adjustment: 35 × 1.13 = 39.6 pints
- Below grade: +5 pints
- No vapor barrier: +5 pints
- **Total needed: ≈50 pints**

## Real-World Sizing Examples

### Example 1: New Townhome Basement in Raleigh, NC (900 sq ft)

**Conditions:** 8-ft ceilings, moderately damp (55% RH in summer), concrete slab with no vapor barrier, below grade.
**AHAM chart:** 900 sq ft, moderately damp → 20 pints
**Adjustments:** Below grade (+5), no vapor barrier (+5) = +10 pints
**Total needed:** 30 pints
**Recommendation:** A 35-pint portable gives comfortable headroom. A 50-pint unit would work even better and cost roughly the same to operate due to shorter runtimes.

### Example 2: Finished Basement in Chicago, IL (1,800 sq ft)

**Conditions:** 9-ft ceilings, very damp (65% RH, musty smell), below grade, used as a family room with 4 people regularly.
**AHAM chart:** 1,800 sq ft, very damp → 40 pints
**Adjustments:** Ceiling (×1.13 = 45), below grade (+5), 3+ people (+5) = 55 pints
**Total needed:** 55 pints
**Recommendation:** A 50-pint unit is the minimum; a 70-pint portable is more appropriate. For a finished living space of this size, a whole-house dehumidifier ducted into the HVAC system is the best long-term solution.

### Example 3: Crawl Space in Savannah, GA (1,200 sq ft)

**Conditions:** 4-ft ceiling (crawl space), extremely wet (85%+ RH), dirt floor partially covered with vapor barrier, hot and humid climate.
**AHAM chart:** 1,200 sq ft, extremely wet → 45 pints
**Adjustments:** Ceiling height is half standard (but crawl space moisture load is extreme): +10 for exposed dirt, +5 for below grade = 60 pints minimum
**Total needed:** 60+ pints with low-temperature capability
**Recommendation:** Santa Fe Compact70 or similar crawl-space-rated unit. Must be rated to operate at temperatures as low as 49°F. Encapsulate the crawl space with a full vapor barrier for maximum effectiveness.

### Example 4: Open-Plan Apartment in Miami, FL (1,100 sq ft)

**Conditions:** 10-ft ceilings, very damp (68% RH despite running AC), kitchen and bathroom contribute significant moisture, multiple exterior doors.
**AHAM chart:** 1,100 sq ft, very damp → 30 pints
**Adjustments:** Ceiling (×1.25 = 38), frequent door opening (+5), kitchen moisture (+5) = 48 pints
**Total needed:** 48 pints
**Recommendation:** A 50-pint ENERGY STAR portable is ideal. Set it to 48% and let it cycle automatically. Place near the kitchen/bathroom end of the apartment where most moisture originates.

## Common Sizing Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Trusting the "Room Size" on the Box

Manufacturers often list "up to 4,500 sq ft" on a 50-pint dehumidifier box. That's the maximum area for *moderately damp* conditions with 8-ft ceilings. For a wet basement with tall ceilings, that same unit might only adequately cover 1,500 sq ft. Always use the AHAM chart with your actual moisture conditions.

### Mistake 2: Sizing Based on Old (Pre-2020) Standards

In 2020, the DOE changed how dehumidifier capacity is tested. The new standard tests at 65°F/60% RH instead of the old 80°F/60% RH. A unit rated "70 pints" under the old standard is rated approximately "50 pints" under the new standard. If you're comparing old recommendations to new products, you'll undersize by about 30%.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Air Leakage

A perfectly sized dehumidifier will struggle if the space has massive air infiltration. Every cubic foot of humid outdoor air that leaks in adds to the moisture load. Seal air leaks — especially in basements (rim joists, window frames, duct penetrations) — before finalizing your sizing.

### Mistake 4: Using Multiple Small Units Instead of One Right-Sized Unit

Two 25-pint dehumidifiers don't equal one 50-pint in practice. The 50-pint unit has a larger fan, better air circulation, and higher efficiency (IEF). Two small units use more combined electricity, create more noise, and require two buckets to empty. One properly sized unit is always better.

### Mistake 5: Sizing for Current Conditions, Not Worst Case

Your basement might read 58% RH today, but what about after three days of rain in August? Size for the worst conditions you expect, not the average. A unit that handles the worst days will easily manage normal days with shorter runtimes.

<Callout type="takeaway">
- Use the AHAM sizing chart as your starting point: room size × moisture severity = base pint rating
- Adjust upward for tall ceilings (multiply by ceiling height factor), below-grade spaces (+5 pints), missing vapor barriers (+5–10 pints), and high-occupancy rooms (+5 pints)
- Always size up, not down — a 50-pint unit in a 35-pint space runs shorter cycles and costs less to operate
- Fix water intrusion and seal air leaks before relying on a dehumidifier
- Post-2020 capacity ratings are ~30% lower than pre-2020 for the same performance — don't confuse old and new standards

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "Is a 50-pint dehumidifier enough for a basement?",
    answer: "A 50-pint dehumidifier covers most basements up to about 2,000 sq ft with moderate to very damp conditions (up to 70% RH). For larger basements, extremely wet conditions (80%+ RH), or basements with tall ceilings, you may need a 70-pint portable or a whole-house ducted system. Use the AHAM chart with your specific square footage and moisture level for an accurate answer."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my dehumidifier is too small?",
    answer: "An undersized dehumidifier runs continuously, never reaches your target humidity, consumes maximum electricity 24/7, and burns out its compressor in 2-3 years instead of the typical 7-10 year lifespan. It's the most expensive mistake you can make — both in energy costs and premature replacement."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a dehumidifier be too big for a room?",
    answer: "Technically yes, but in practice, oversizing is rarely a problem. A unit that's too large will reach your target humidity quickly and cycle off. It runs fewer hours, uses less total electricity, and extends its lifespan. The only downside is higher upfront cost. Unlike air conditioners, which can cause humidity problems when oversized, dehumidifiers perform well when oversized."
  },
  {
    question: "What size dehumidifier for 1,000 sq ft?",
    answer: "For 1,000 sq ft: 25 pints if moderately damp, 30 pints if very damp, 35 pints if wet, or 45 pints if extremely wet. Add 5 pints if the space is a basement (below grade), and adjust upward for ceilings taller than 8 feet. In most cases, a 35-50 pint unit handles a 1,000 sq ft space comfortably."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a whole-house dehumidifier?",
    answer: "Consider a whole-house dehumidifier if: your home exceeds 2,500 sq ft, you live in a consistently humid climate (Southeast U.S.), your AC alone can't maintain humidity below 55%, or you're tired of managing portable units in multiple rooms. Whole-house units (70-150 pints/day) connect to your HVAC ductwork and treat the entire home automatically."
  },
  {
    question: "What size dehumidifier for a crawl space?",
    answer: "Most crawl spaces need a 50-70 pint unit rated for low-temperature operation (down to 41-49°F). Crawl spaces are typically extremely damp, and standard dehumidifiers frost over in the cool conditions. Brands like Santa Fe, AprilAire, and AlorAir make crawl-space-specific models with low-temp ratings and durable construction."
  },
  {
    question: "How did the 2020 DOE testing standard change dehumidifier sizing?",
    answer: "Before 2020, dehumidifiers were tested at 80°F and 60% RH. After 2020, they're tested at 65°F and 60% RH. Since units remove more moisture in warmer conditions, the new standard produces lower capacity numbers. A unit that was rated '70 pints' under the old standard is now rated approximately '50 pints.' The unit itself didn't change — just the testing conditions. Always check which standard the rating uses."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I buy one large dehumidifier or two smaller ones?",
    answer: "One properly sized unit is almost always better than two smaller ones. A single large unit has better energy efficiency (higher IEF), better air circulation with its larger fan, one bucket to empty instead of two, and lower total electricity consumption. The only exception is L-shaped spaces or separate rooms where air can't circulate freely between them — then two units may make sense."
  },
  {
    question: "What pint size do I need for a 2,000 sq ft basement?",
    answer: "For a 2,000 sq ft basement: 35 pints if moderately damp, 45 pints if very damp, 50 pints if wet, or 60 pints if extremely wet. With typical adjustments (below grade, standard ceilings), you'll likely need a 50-70 pint portable or a whole-house unit. A 50-pint unit handles most 2,000 sq ft basements well unless conditions are severe."
  },
  {
    question: "How many pints per day should my dehumidifier collect?",
    answer: "In the first 24-48 hours, a correctly sized dehumidifier may collect its full rated capacity (e.g., 50 pints from a 50-pint unit) as it pulls accumulated moisture from the air and materials. After reaching target humidity, collection drops significantly — often to 10-20 pints per day. If your unit consistently collects near-maximum capacity after the first week, it may be undersized or there's an ongoing moisture source."
