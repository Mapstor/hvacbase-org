The quietest mini split on the market in 2026 is the Fujitsu Halcyon RLS3H series at 18 dB on its lowest indoor fan setting, with the Mitsubishi MSZ-FH and DaikinDERA series tied closely behind at 19 dB. To put that in perspective, normal breathing registers around 10 dB and a whisper at 20 dB — these units are literally quieter than a whispered conversation. If noise is your top priority, any mini split from the "Big Three" (Mitsubishi, Daikin, Fujitsu) with a rated indoor noise below 22 dB will be virtually inaudible in a furnished room.

But here's what the marketing brochures don't tell you: that 18–19 dB rating is measured at the lowest fan speed in a controlled laboratory with zero background noise. In your actual living room, you'll run the unit at medium or high fan speed most of the time to get adequate cooling, which bumps the noise to 35–46 dB. Still quiet — but a very different number than the headline spec. This guide gives you the real-world data so you know exactly what to expect.

<TableOfContents />

## What "Below 20 dB" Actually Means

The sub-20 dB ratings that manufacturers advertise deserve some careful unpacking. At 19 dB, a mini split is producing sound energy at roughly the same level as a ticking clock in a quiet room. Most people cannot consciously perceive sounds below 25 dB in a typical home environment because ambient background noise (traffic, appliances, wind) already sits at 25–35 dB.

This means that in practice, the difference between a 19 dB unit and a 24 dB unit is imperceptible in the vast majority of homes. Both will be masked by normal background noise. The sub-20 dB rating becomes meaningful only in extremely quiet environments: recording studios, audiophile listening rooms, nurseries in rural homes, or bedrooms on very quiet streets.

### Lab Conditions vs. Your Living Room

| Measurement Condition | Typical dB Reading | Why It Differs |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Anechoic chamber (lab test) | 18–19 dB | Zero reflections, zero background noise |
| Quiet bedroom, rural home | 20–25 dB ambient | Minimal background noise to mask unit |
| Average bedroom, suburban home | 28–35 dB ambient | Some traffic, appliance hum masks unit |
| Living room, TV off | 30–38 dB ambient | Refrigerator, clock, minor traffic |
| Living room, TV on | 45–55 dB ambient | Unit is completely inaudible |
| Home office during video call | 35–45 dB ambient | Unit audible only at highest fan speeds |

<Callout type="tip">
If your home's ambient background noise is above 30 dB (most suburban homes), you don't need to pay a premium for a sub-20 dB unit. A quality 22–25 dB unit will be equally inaudible. Save the premium for better efficiency or additional zones instead.

| 9 | Daikin DERA12 | 12,000 | 20 | 47 | 62 | 28.0 | 11.8 | $4,000–$5,500 |
| 10 | Gree Sapphire (SAP09HP230V1A) | 9,000 | 22 | 45 | 56 | 28.0 | 11.0 | $2,800–$3,800 |

### Larger Single-Zone Models (18,000–36,000 BTU)

Larger mini splits are inherently louder because they move more air and have larger compressors. Even so, premium models keep indoor noise remarkably low.

| Brand & Model | Size (BTU) | Indoor dB (Low) | Indoor dB (High) | Outdoor dB | SEER2 | Est. Price (Installed) |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|----------------------|
| Mitsubishi MSZ-FH18 | 18,000 | 21 | 47 | 62 | 26.0 | $5,200–$6,800 |
| Fujitsu RLS3H (18RLSH) | 18,000 | 21 | 46 | 60 | 25.0 | $5,000–$6,500 |
| Daikin DERA18 | 18,000 | 22 | 48 | 63 | 24.5 | $4,800–$6,200 |
| Mitsubishi MSZ-FH24 | 24,000 | 23 | 49 | 64 | 22.0 | $5,800–$7,500 |
| Fujitsu RLS3H (24RLSH) | 24,000 | 23 | 48 | 62 | 21.5 | $5,500–$7,200 |
| Mitsubishi MSZ-FH36 | 36,000 | 26 | 51 | 66 | 18.5 | $6,500–$8,500 |

<Callout type="info">
Notice how even the quietest 36,000 BTU unit at 26 dB on low is louder than a 9,000 BTU unit at the same fan speed. If noise is the top priority and you need large capacity, consider multiple smaller units in different zones rather than one large unit. Two 18,000 BTU units at 21 dB each are quieter than one 36,000 BTU unit at 26 dB.

## Deep Dive: The Top 5 Quietest Models

### 1. Fujitsu Halcyon RLS3H Series — 18 dB

The Fujitsu RLS3H holds the title for the quietest mini split you can buy in 2026. The 9,000 BTU model achieves 18 dB at its minimum fan speed, thanks to a proprietary low-turbulence fan blade design and a DC inverter compressor that can throttle down to as low as 10% of rated capacity.

**What makes it special:** Fujitsu's noise advantage comes from three engineering choices. First, the indoor unit's cross-flow fan uses a blade profile optimized in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to minimize turbulence at low speeds. Second, the refrigerant metering uses an electronic expansion valve (EEV) rather than a capillary tube, eliminating the hissing sound common in less expensive units. Third, the compressor mounting uses a triple-isolation system with rubber grommets, springs, and a sound-dampening compressor blanket.

**Who it's for:** Recording studios, nurseries, master bedrooms in quiet homes, audiophile listening rooms.

**Trade-offs:** The RLS3H is one of the most expensive single-zone mini splits available. The 18 dB rating is only at the absolute minimum fan speed — you'll see 25–30 dB at the normal "quiet" setting and 43 dB at high fan. The outdoor unit at 55 dB is excellent but not class-leading (Samsung's WindFree achieves 54 dB outdoors).

**Real-world example:** An audiophile in Vermont installed the 9K RLS3H in his dedicated listening room. Measured with a calibrated sound meter, the unit at minimum fan produced 21 dB at 6 feet (slightly above lab spec due to room reflections) — well below the room's 28 dB ambient floor. At medium fan speed for normal cooling, it measured 33 dB, still quiet enough for critical listening during all but the softest musical passages.

### 2. Mitsubishi MSZ-FH Series — 19 dB

Mitsubishi's flagship residential line, the MSZ-FH (Hyper-Heating), is only 1 dB louder than the Fujitsu RLS3H indoors but offers superior cold-climate heating performance down to -13°F. It's the go-to choice for noise-sensitive homeowners who also need reliable heating in harsh winters.

**What makes it special:** The MSZ-FH uses Mitsubishi's 3D i-see Sensor, an infrared occupancy and temperature sensor that scans the room and directs airflow toward or away from occupants. When the room reaches setpoint, the system can enter a near-silent mode where it barely moves air, maintaining temperature through radiant exchange with the cold evaporator coil. This "still air" mode can drop perceived noise below the 19 dB floor.

**Who it's for:** Cold-climate homeowners (northern US, Canada) who need both quiet cooling and heating down to extreme temperatures.

**Trade-offs:** Mitsubishi's premium pricing is the highest in the industry. The 3D i-see Sensor adds cost and complexity. Some users report that the auto-vane movement (as the sensor directs airflow) produces occasional clicking sounds not captured in the dB rating.

**Real-world example:** A couple in Minnesota installed four MSZ-FH09 units throughout their 2,200 sq ft home, replacing an aging furnace and central AC. During a January cold snap at -8°F, the units maintained 70°F indoors while producing 25–28 dB in the bedrooms (on heating mode's quiet setting). Their old furnace had measured 52 dB at the nearest bedroom register.

### 3. Daikin DERA Series — 19 dB

Daikin, the world's largest HVAC manufacturer, matches Mitsubishi's 19 dB indoor rating in their DERA series. Daikin's advantage is their extensive dealer network and typically lower pricing for comparable performance.

**What makes it special:** Daikin manufactures their own compressors (unlike some brands that source from third parties), giving them tight control over noise optimization at every production stage. The DERA series uses a swing compressor design that produces less vibration than traditional rotary compressors, with a claimed 2–3 dB advantage in the outdoor unit compared to previous-generation models.

**Who it's for:** Homeowners who want near-top-tier noise performance with a wider installer network and potentially lower cost than Mitsubishi or Fujitsu.

**Trade-offs:** The outdoor unit is louder than both Fujitsu and Mitsubishi (60 dB vs. 55–58 dB for a 9K unit). Indoor air quality features are less advanced than Mitsubishi's. The high-speed fan noise (46 dB) is the highest of the top three, so if you need maximum cooling on hot days, Daikin will be noticeably louder.

### 4. LG Art Cool Gallery — 21 dB

LG's Art Cool Gallery takes a different approach: it's not the absolute quietest, but it's the quietest unit that doesn't look like an HVAC product. The indoor unit features a flat-panel design that displays artwork (digital frame style), making it a favorite for design-conscious homeowners.

**What makes it special:** The Art Cool Gallery uses LG's Dual Inverter compressor with a BLDC motor that maintains a constant speed with minimal fluctuation, reducing the pulsating noise common in cheaper inverter units. The indoor unit's flat-panel design also means there's no protruding fan grille to generate turbulence noise.

**Who it's for:** Homeowners who prioritize aesthetics alongside noise performance — living rooms, bedrooms, and spaces where a traditional wall-mounted unit would be visually intrusive.

**Trade-offs:** At 21 dB, it's perceptibly louder than the 18–19 dB leaders in extremely quiet rooms. The artwork display feature adds some electronic noise (barely perceptible). SEER2 of 27.5 is good but not best-in-class. Replacement art panels add to lifetime cost.

### 5. Samsung WindFree — 21 dB

Samsung's WindFree technology eliminates the feeling of direct airflow by dispersing conditioned air through 23,000 micro-holes in the front panel instead of directing it through vanes. This creates a "still air" effect that many users perceive as even quieter than the 21 dB rating suggests.

**What makes it special:** The WindFree dispersal technology doesn't just reduce perceived noise — it eliminates the drafty feeling that makes some people notice their AC. When you can't feel the air moving, you're less likely to hear it. Samsung also claims the quietest outdoor unit in this comparison at 54 dB.

**Who it's for:** People who are sensitive to both noise and drafts. Excellent for bedrooms and home offices.

**Real-world example:** A light sleeper in Austin installed the WindFree unit in her master bedroom. She reported that while her previous Mitsubishi MSZ-GL (rated 24 dB) was already quiet, the Samsung felt "silent" because the absence of direct airflow removed her awareness of the unit entirely. Measured noise was actually comparable (22 dB vs. 26 dB in the room), but perceived comfort was significantly better.

## Multi-Zone Mini Splits: Noise Considerations

When you install a multi-zone mini split system, the outdoor unit is larger and louder than a single-zone unit because it serves multiple indoor heads. Here's how multi-zone outdoor units compare:

| Brand | 2-Zone Outdoor dB | 3-Zone Outdoor dB | 4-Zone Outdoor dB | 5-Zone Outdoor dB |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Mitsubishi MXZ Series | 58–61 | 60–63 | 62–65 | 64–66 |
| Daikin Multi-Zone | 60–63 | 62–65 | 63–66 | 65–68 |
| Fujitsu AOU Multi | 58–62 | 60–64 | 62–66 | 64–68 |
| LG Multi F | 59–62 | 61–64 | 63–66 | 65–67 |
| Samsung Multi-Zone | 57–60 | 59–63 | 61–65 | 63–67 |

<Callout type="warning">
Multi-zone outdoor units run their compressor harder because they serve multiple indoor units simultaneously. Even when only one zone is calling for cooling, the outdoor unit may be louder than a single-zone equivalent because the compressor is sized for the total system capacity. If outdoor noise is critical, consider multiple single-zone systems instead of one multi-zone system — you'll get quieter outdoor units at the cost of more equipment and higher installation expense.
</Callout>

### Multi-Zone Indoor Unit Noise

The good news: indoor unit noise in a multi-zone system is identical to single-zone. The indoor heads are the same hardware whether connected to a single-zone or multi-zone outdoor unit. A Mitsubishi MSZ-FH09 still operates at 19 dB regardless of the outdoor unit it's connected to.

## Noise at Different Fan Speeds: The Full Picture

Marketing materials highlight the minimum fan speed dB rating, but you'll use multiple fan speeds depending on conditions. Here's what each speed sounds like across the top models:

| Model | Silent/Min | Low | Medium | High | Turbo/Max |
|-------|-----------|-----|--------|------|-----------|
| Fujitsu RLS3H 9K | 18 dB | 24 dB | 33 dB | 38 dB | 43 dB |
| Mitsubishi MSZ-FH09 | 19 dB | 24 dB | 32 dB | 39 dB | 44 dB |
| Daikin DERA09 | 19 dB | 26 dB | 35 dB | 41 dB | 46 dB |
| LG Art Cool 9K | 21 dB | 27 dB | 35 dB | 40 dB | 44 dB |
| Samsung WindFree 9K | 21 dB | 26 dB | 34 dB | 39 dB | 43 dB |
| Gree Sapphire 9K | 22 dB | 28 dB | 36 dB | 42 dB | 48 dB |
| MrCool DIY 4th Gen 9K | 25 dB | 30 dB | 38 dB | 44 dB | 48 dB |

**When you'll use each speed:**

- **Silent/Min:** Nighttime in a well-insulated room that's already at setpoint. The unit barely moves air.
- **Low:** Nighttime maintenance when the room needs mild cooling. Used 20–30% of the time.
- **Medium:** Normal daytime operation. This is where you'll spend 40–50% of operating hours.
- **High:** Hot afternoons when the system needs to pull down temperature. 15–25% of operating time.
- **Turbo/Max:** Rarely used. When you come home to a hot house and need fast cooling.

<Callout type="tip">
For the quietest nighttime experience, set your mini split to "auto" mode with a sleep timer or night mode function. Most premium units will automatically reduce fan speed to the minimum once the room reaches setpoint, keeping noise at the lowest possible level through the night.
</Callout>

## Installation Factors That Affect Mini Split Noise

Even the quietest mini split can become annoyingly loud with a poor installation. Here are the factors your installer controls:

### Indoor Unit Mounting

The indoor head should be mounted on a solid wall — not a thin partition or drywall over an empty cavity. Vibration from the fan motor transfers into the wall, and thin walls amplify it. If the wall is lightweight, have your installer add a plywood backer board (3/4" minimum) behind the mounting plate.

Mount height matters too. The standard height is 7–8 feet, near the ceiling. Mounting lower puts the unit closer to ear level, making any noise more noticeable.

### Refrigerant Line Routing

Refrigerant flowing through copper lines produces a faint gurgling or swooshing sound, especially during startup and when the compressor changes speed. This sound is normal but becomes audible if the lines run through a quiet bedroom wall. Best practice is to route lines through closets, utility spaces, or exterior walls rather than directly through bedroom walls.

Refrigerant lines should never contact framing members directly. Rubber grommets at every penetration point and foam insulation on all interior line sections prevent vibration transfer.

### Outdoor Unit Placement

The outdoor condenser should sit on a solid, level surface. A concrete pad with rubber vibration isolation pads is ideal. Avoid mounting the outdoor unit directly on a wooden deck or wall bracket — these structures amplify vibration and transmit it through the building.

Distance from windows matters enormously. Every doubling of distance reduces noise by 6 dB:

| Distance from Bedroom Window | 55 dB Unit (Fujitsu RLS3H) | 62 dB Unit (Budget brand) |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| 3 feet | 55 dB | 62 dB |
| 6 feet | 49 dB | 56 dB |
| 12 feet | 43 dB | 50 dB |
| 25 feet | 37 dB | 44 dB |

### Condensate Drain

A properly routed condensate drain is silent. An improperly routed drain can produce dripping or gurgling sounds as water flows downhill. Ensure the drain has a continuous downhill slope with no traps or dips where water can pool and gurgle.

### Line Set Length

Longer line sets (the copper tubing connecting indoor and outdoor units) cause the compressor to work harder, which can slightly increase outdoor unit noise. Most mini splits perform optimally with 15–25 feet of line set. Runs over 50 feet may add 2–3 dB to outdoor noise and reduce efficiency.

## DIY Mini Splits: How Quiet Are They?

The MrCool DIY and similar self-install mini splits have made ductless systems accessible to handy homeowners. But are they as quiet as professionally installed units from premium brands?

| Feature | MrCool DIY 4th Gen | Pioneer WYS | Senville AURA | Professional (Mitsubishi) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Indoor dB (low) | 25 | 28 | 30 | 19 |
| Indoor dB (high) | 48 | 52 | 53 | 44 |
| Outdoor dB | 62 | 64 | 65 | 58 |
| SEER2 | 22.0 | 19.0 | 18.5 | 33.1 |
| Inverter compressor | Yes | Yes | Yes (basic) | Yes (advanced) |
| Price (equipment only) | $1,500–$2,000 | $1,000–$1,500 | $900–$1,300 | $2,500–$3,500 |

DIY units are 6–11 dB louder indoors than premium brands. That's significant — 10 dB is perceived as roughly twice as loud. The noise penalty comes from less sophisticated compressor technology, lower-quality fan blades, and simplified vibration isolation.

**Real-world example — The garage workshop:** Dave in Colorado installed a MrCool DIY 12K in his detached garage workshop. At 28 dB on low speed, the unit was completely masked by his tool noise during work hours. But when he tried the same model in his home office, the 38 dB at medium speed was noticeable during quiet video calls. He ended up swapping the office unit for a Mitsubishi MSZ-FH at 32 dB medium speed — a just-noticeable improvement that kept the unit below his awareness threshold.

<Callout type="example">
**Budget vs. Premium: Is the Noise Difference Worth the Cost?**

A MrCool DIY 9K costs roughly $1,800 installed (DIY) vs. $4,500 for a professionally installed Mitsubishi MSZ-FH09.

The noise difference: 25 dB vs. 19 dB on low speed. In an average suburban bedroom (30 dB ambient), both units are inaudible. In a quiet rural bedroom (22 dB ambient), the Mitsubishi is imperceptible while the MrCool is faintly audible.

The efficiency difference: 22 SEER2 vs. 33.1 SEER2. On a 9,000 BTU unit running 1,500 hours per year at $0.14/kWh, the Mitsubishi saves roughly $40–$60/year in electricity.

**Verdict:** If you live in a quiet environment and prioritize noise, the premium brand is worth it. If your home has normal ambient noise, the DIY unit is a smart value play.

## Noise Reduction Accessories for Mini Splits

If you've already installed a mini split and want it quieter, these accessories can help:

### Outdoor Unit Sound Barriers

A three-sided barrier (leaving the front open for airflow) made from mass-loaded vinyl (MLV) on a wooden frame can reduce outdoor unit noise by 5–10 dB at the property line. Cost: $200–$600 DIY, $500–$1,500 professional.

### Compressor Sound Blankets

Aftermarket compressor blankets wrap around the outdoor unit's compressor to dampen vibration and absorb sound. Reduction: 2–5 dB. Cost: $80–$200. Available from brands like Brinmar and Universal.

### Vibration Isolation Pads

Rubber or neoprene anti-vibration pads placed under the outdoor unit prevent vibration from transmitting through the mounting surface. Essential for any unit mounted on a deck, bracket, or rooftop. Reduction: 3–8 dB (of structure-borne noise). Cost: $20–$60.

### Indoor Unit Vibration Dampeners

Rubber isolation bushings between the indoor unit's mounting plate and the wall can reduce the barely perceptible hum that transfers through the wall. Reduction: 1–3 dB. Cost: $10–$30. Most useful for thin walls.

## Smart Features That Reduce Perceived Noise

Modern mini splits include software features that manage noise:

**Night/Sleep Mode:** Automatically reduces fan speed to minimum and may raise the setpoint by 1–2°F over the night to keep the compressor at its quietest operating point.

**Auto Fan Mode:** Adjusts fan speed based on the difference between room temperature and setpoint. When close to setpoint, the unit runs barely above its minimum, keeping noise low.

**Quiet Mode:** Available on Mitsubishi, Daikin, and Fujitsu. Caps the compressor and fan at a reduced maximum, typically cutting 3–5 dB from maximum noise at the cost of reduced peak capacity.

**Smart Scheduling:** Via Wi-Fi control (Mitsubishi kumo cloud, Daikin One+, Fujitsu FGLair), you can pre-cool rooms before bedtime so the system only needs maintenance-level operation through the night.

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What is the quietest mini split you can buy in 2026?",
    answer: "The Fujitsu Halcyon RLS3H series holds the record at 18 dB on the lowest indoor fan speed. The Mitsubishi MSZ-FH and Daikin DERA series are close behind at 19 dB. All three are virtually inaudible in a normal home environment. The Samsung WindFree at 21 dB also deserves consideration for its draftless design that makes it feel even quieter than its measured noise."
  },
  {
    question: "Is 19 dB really inaudible?",
    answer: "In most homes, yes. The ambient background noise in a typical suburban bedroom is 28–35 dB, which completely masks a 19 dB sound source. You'd need an exceptionally quiet environment — a rural home with no traffic, no appliance hum, and closed windows — to hear a 19 dB mini split on its lowest setting. At medium fan speed (32–35 dB), you might notice a faint airflow sound in very quiet rooms."
  },
  {
    question: "Are mini splits quieter than central air?",
    answer: "Yes, significantly. Mini split indoor units range from 18–25 dB on low speed versus 35–50 dB for a central AC air handler. Mini splits also eliminate ductwork noise entirely — the rushing, whistling, and banging sounds that ducts produce. Outdoor mini split condensers are typically 5–15 dB quieter than central AC condensers as well."
  },
  {
    question: "Do multi-zone mini splits make more noise?",
    answer: "The indoor units are equally quiet in both single-zone and multi-zone configurations — the same hardware is used. However, multi-zone outdoor units are 3–8 dB louder than single-zone equivalents because they have larger compressors to serve multiple indoor heads. If outdoor noise is critical, consider separate single-zone systems instead of one multi-zone system."
  },
  {
    question: "How loud is a mini split on high fan speed?",
    answer: "Premium mini splits reach 42–46 dB on high fan speed, while budget models hit 48–55 dB. At high speed, even premium units are clearly audible — comparable to a quiet conversation or light rainfall. You'll typically only use high speed when cooling a hot room quickly. Normal operation at medium speed is 32–38 dB for premium models."
  },
  {
    question: "Are MrCool DIY mini splits loud?",
    answer: "Compared to premium brands, yes. The MrCool DIY 4th Generation is rated at 25 dB on low speed (vs. 18–19 dB for premium brands) and 48 dB on high speed (vs. 43–44 dB). In a typical home, you'll notice the difference mainly during quiet nighttime hours. For garages, workshops, and rooms with normal daytime ambient noise, the MrCool is perfectly acceptable."
  },
  {
    question: "What causes a mini split to make unusual noises?",
    answer: "Common mini split noises include clicking (normal expansion valve operation), gurgling (refrigerant flowing at startup/shutdown), hissing (normal refrigerant flow or possible leak if loud), and crackling (plastic housing expanding with temperature changes). Loud buzzing, grinding, or rattling are not normal and indicate a problem — contact your installer. A properly functioning mini split should produce only a faint airflow sound."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I make my existing mini split quieter?",
    answer: "Yes. Add rubber vibration isolation pads under the outdoor unit ($20–$60), install a compressor sound blanket ($80–$200), build a three-sided sound barrier around the outdoor unit ($200–$600), use night/sleep mode at bedtime, and ensure the condensate drain has a smooth downhill slope with no gurgling traps. Indoor noise can be reduced by adding rubber isolation bushings to the mounting plate."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Fujitsu or Mitsubishi quieter?",
    answer: "Fujitsu wins by 1 dB indoors (18 vs. 19 dB on low speed) and 2–3 dB outdoors (55 vs. 58 dB for 9K units). However, Mitsubishi offers better cold-climate heating performance and a more extensive dealer/service network. In practice, the 1 dB indoor difference is imperceptible. Choose Fujitsu if noise is the absolute top priority; choose Mitsubishi if you also need strong heating performance below 0°F."

    question: "How much more do quiet mini splits cost?",
    answer: "The quietest models (18–19 dB) typically cost $4,000–$6,000 installed for a single-zone system. Mid-tier quiet models (21–24 dB) run $3,200–$5,000 installed. Budget DIY models (25–30 dB) cost $1,500–$2,500 for the unit alone. The premium for top-tier quiet is roughly $1,500–$3,000 over a mid-tier unit, or $2,500–$4,000 over a DIY unit."
