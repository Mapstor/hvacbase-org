# How Much Does a Pellet Stove Cost to Run? (Per Month)

A pellet stove costs **$150 to $350 per month** to run during the heating season, including pellet fuel ($120 to $300/month) and electricity for the auger and fans ($10 to $15/month). For a typical 1,800 sq ft home in a cold climate (zone 5), expect roughly **$250/month** in total operating costs, or about $1,250 to $1,500 for a full October-through-March heating season.

That makes pellet stoves among the most cost-effective heating options available in 2026. Wood pellets cost $14 to $19 per million BTU of useful heat, which undercuts electricity ($33 to $55/MMBTU) and competes favorably with natural gas ($10 to $25/MMBTU) in most markets. Below, we break down every cost component so you can calculate your exact numbers.

<TableOfContents />

## Pellet Fuel: The Biggest Cost

Pellet fuel accounts for 85 to 90 percent of your total operating cost. Here are the fundamental numbers for 2026:

**Pellet pricing basics:**
- 1 ton = 50 bags at 40 lbs each = 2,000 lbs total
- National average price: $280/ton for premium grade
- Per-bag price: $5.00 to $6.20 for premium
- Energy content: 8,000 to 8,500 BTU per pound (premium grade)
- Gross energy per ton: 16 to 17 million BTU
- Useful energy per ton at 80% efficiency: 12.8 to 13.6 million BTU

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Pellet Grade", "Price/Ton", "Price/Bag", "BTU/Pound", "Useful BTU/Ton (80% eff)", "Cost per Million BTU"]}
  rows={[
    ["Premium (PFI certified)", "$250-$310", "$5.00-$6.20", "8,000-8,500", "12.8-13.6M", "$18.38-$24.22"],
    ["Standard (PFI certified)", "$200-$250", "$4.00-$5.00", "7,500-8,000", "12.0-12.8M", "$15.63-$20.83"],
    ["Utility / Off-brand", "$150-$200", "$3.00-$4.00", "7,000-7,500", "11.2-12.0M", "$12.50-$17.86"]
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
**Always buy PFI-certified premium pellets.** The $50 to $100/ton you save with utility-grade pellets gets eaten up by increased maintenance. Cheap pellets have 3 to 6 percent ash content versus less than 1 percent for premium, which means more clinkers, more burn-pot wear, and more frequent cleaning. One burn-pot replacement ($150 to $300) wipes out years of pellet savings.

## Regional Pellet Prices in 2026

Wood pellet prices vary significantly by geography. Proximity to pellet mills, regional demand, and shipping costs all affect pricing.

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Region", "Premium ($/ton)", "Premium ($/bag)", "Best Time to Buy", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Pacific Northwest (OR, WA, ID)", "$230-$270", "$4.60-$5.40", "May-July", "Lowest prices; many regional mills"],
    ["Southeast (VA, NC, SC, GA)", "$240-$280", "$4.80-$5.60", "June-August", "Growing production capacity"],
    ["Midwest (MI, WI, MN, OH)", "$250-$300", "$5.00-$6.00", "June-August", "Strong supply from regional mills"],
    ["Northeast (PA, NY, ME, VT, NH)", "$260-$310", "$5.20-$6.20", "May-July", "Highest demand region; order early"],
    ["Mountain West (CO, MT, WY)", "$260-$300", "$5.20-$6.00", "June-August", "Limited local production"],
    ["National Average", "$280", "$5.60", "Late spring/early summer", "Prices peak December-February"]
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**Buy pellets in the off-season.** Pellet prices typically drop 10 to 15 percent between May and August when demand is lowest. A homeowner who needs 4 tons for winter can save $112 to $186 by ordering in June versus December. Many dealers offer free delivery for 2-plus ton orders during spring and summer. Lock in pricing early and store pellets in a dry garage or covered area.

## Monthly Pellet Consumption by Home Size

How many bags of pellets you burn depends on your home size, insulation quality, outdoor temperatures, and stove efficiency. Here is a practical consumption guide:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Home Size (sq ft)", "Climate Zone 3-4 (Moderate)", "Climate Zone 5 (Cold)", "Climate Zone 6-7 (Very Cold)"]}
  rows={[
    ["800", "1-1.5 bags/day ($168-$252/mo)", "1.5-2 bags/day ($252-$336/mo)", "2-2.5 bags/day ($336-$420/mo)"],
    ["1,200", "1.5-2 bags/day ($252-$336/mo)", "2-2.5 bags/day ($336-$420/mo)", "2.5-3.5 bags/day ($420-$588/mo)"],
    ["1,500", "1.5-2.5 bags/day ($252-$420/mo)", "2.5-3 bags/day ($420-$504/mo)", "3-4 bags/day ($504-$672/mo)"],
    ["1,800", "2-2.5 bags/day ($336-$420/mo)", "2.5-3.5 bags/day ($420-$588/mo)", "3.5-4.5 bags/day ($588-$756/mo)"],
    ["2,200", "2-3 bags/day ($336-$504/mo)", "3-4 bags/day ($504-$672/mo)", "4-5 bags/day ($672-$840/mo)"],
    ["2,500", "2.5-3 bags/day ($420-$504/mo)", "3.5-4.5 bags/day ($588-$756/mo)", "4.5-6 bags/day ($756-$1,008/mo)"]
  ]}
/>

*Monthly costs calculated at $5.60/bag for premium pellets over 30-day months.*

**Real-world example 1 - Mid-size home in Pennsylvania (Zone 5):** A 1,600 sq ft colonial with R-13 wall insulation and an R-38 attic runs a Harman Absolute63 on a thermostat set to 70 degrees F. During January (average outdoor temp 28 degrees F), the stove consumed 2.8 bags per day on average. Monthly pellet cost: 2.8 bags times 30 days times $5.60 = $470.40. Adding $11.50 in electricity, total January cost was $481.90.

**Real-world example 2 - Small cabin in North Carolina (Zone 4):** A 900 sq ft well-insulated cabin uses a Castle Serenity stove. During the mild winter months (average outdoor temp 42 degrees F), consumption averaged 1.2 bags per day. Monthly cost: 1.2 times 30 times $5.20 = $187.20 plus $8 electricity = $195.20.

## Electricity Cost for Running a Pellet Stove

Pellet stoves need electricity for the auger motor, combustion blower, convection fan, control board, and igniter. Here is a typical breakdown:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Component", "Wattage", "Daily Hours", "Monthly Cost at $0.168/kWh"]}
  rows={[
    ["Auger motor", "60-100W", "8-16 hrs (intermittent)", "$2.42-$8.06"],
    ["Combustion blower", "30-80W", "8-16 hrs", "$1.21-$6.45"],
    ["Convection blower", "50-120W", "8-16 hrs", "$2.02-$9.68"],
    ["Electric igniter", "300-400W", "5-10 min per start", "$0.15-$0.40"],
    ["Control board / display", "5-15W", "24 hrs", "$0.60-$1.81"],
    ["Total (active operation)", "145-315W", "8-16 hrs/day", "$5.85-$15.22"]
  ]}
/>

**Average pellet stove electricity cost: $8 to $12 per month** during the heating season with 10 to 14 hours of daily operation. This small cost is often overlooked in calculations but matters for two reasons. First, it adds up over a season ($40 to $72). Second, and more importantly, the stove cannot operate at all during a power outage without a battery backup or generator.

**Real-world example 3 - Electricity monitoring:** A homeowner with a Comfortbilt HP22 plugged their stove into a Kill A Watt meter for the entire month of February. The stove ran approximately 14 hours per day, cycling between high and low via the thermostat. Total electricity consumption: 201 kWh for the month. At their Ohio rate of $0.152/kWh, the electricity cost was $30.55 — higher than average because this model has a less efficient convection fan motor than premium brands.

## Seasonal and Annual Cost Summary

Here is the full picture of what a pellet stove costs to run, including fuel, electricity, and prorated maintenance:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Cost Component", "Monthly (Heating Season)", "Per Season (6 months)", "Annual (incl. off-season)"]}
  rows={[
    ["Pellet fuel (avg. 2.5 bags/day)", "$420", "$2,520", "$2,520"],
    ["Electricity (stove operation)", "$10", "$60", "$60"],
    ["Maintenance (prorated)", "$25", "$150", "$150-$300"],
    ["Pellet storage / delivery", "-", "$0-$100", "$0-$100"],
    ["Total - Moderate user (1,500 sq ft, Zone 4)", "$195-$300", "$975-$1,500", "$1,125-$1,700"],
    ["Total - Average user (1,800 sq ft, Zone 5)", "$280-$400", "$1,400-$2,000", "$1,550-$2,200"],
    ["Total - Heavy user (2,200 sq ft, Zone 6)", "$400-$550", "$2,000-$2,750", "$2,150-$2,950"]

## Pellet Stove vs. Every Other Heating Option: Cost Per Million BTU

The true cost comparison requires looking at cost per useful BTU delivered, not just fuel price. Here is how pellet stoves compare to every major heating option in 2026:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Fuel Source", "Fuel Unit Price", "BTU per Unit", "Appliance Efficiency", "Cost per Million BTU (Useful)"]}
  rows={[
    ["Wood pellets (premium)", "$280/ton", "16.5M BTU/ton", "75-83%", "$20.36-$22.42"],
    ["Natural gas", "$1.20/therm", "100,000 BTU/therm", "80-96%", "$12.50-$15.00"],
    ["Propane", "$2.50/gallon", "91,500 BTU/gal", "80-95%", "$28.76-$34.23"],
    ["Heating oil (#2)", "$3.80/gallon", "138,500 BTU/gal", "80-90%", "$30.48-$34.29"],
    ["Electricity (resistance)", "$0.168/kWh", "3,412 BTU/kWh", "99%", "$49.71"],
    ["Electricity (heat pump, COP 3)", "$0.168/kWh", "3,412 BTU/kWh", "300%", "$16.41"],
    ["Cordwood (hardwood)", "$350/cord", "20M BTU/cord", "60-75%", "$23.33-$29.17"],
    ["Cordwood (softwood)", "$250/cord", "15M BTU/cord", "60-75%", "$22.22-$27.78"]
  ]}
/>

**Key insight:** Pellet stoves beat propane, heating oil, and electric resistance heating handily. They're competitive with natural gas in regions where gas is more expensive (above $1.30/therm). Heat pumps are the only technology that consistently beats pellets on operating cost, but heat pumps lose effectiveness in very cold climates (below 15 degrees F) where pellet stoves excel.

**Real-world example 4 - Fuel switching savings:** A homeowner in rural Vermont switched from propane ($2.80/gallon, 500 gallons/season = $1,400) to a pellet stove (3.5 tons at $300/ton = $1,050, plus $65 electricity). Annual fuel savings: $285. Adding in the eliminated propane tank rental ($150/year) and furnace maintenance ($200/year), total annual savings jumped to $635. The $4,500 installed pellet stove paid for itself in 7.1 years. After payback, the savings are pure gain.

## Total Cost of Ownership: 10-Year Analysis

Operating cost is only part of the picture. Here is the full 10-year cost of ownership for a pellet stove versus common alternatives:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Cost Category", "Pellet Stove", "Gas Furnace", "Oil Furnace", "Electric Baseboard", "Heat Pump"]}
  rows={[
    ["Equipment cost", "$1,500-$4,500", "$2,500-$5,000", "$3,000-$6,000", "$500-$2,000", "$3,500-$7,000"],
    ["Installation", "$1,200-$3,000", "$500-$2,000", "$500-$2,000", "$200-$1,000", "$1,500-$3,500"],
    ["Annual fuel cost", "$1,100-$2,400", "$800-$1,800", "$1,500-$3,000", "$1,500-$4,000", "$600-$1,400"],
    ["Annual maintenance", "$150-$350", "$100-$250", "$200-$400", "$0", "$100-$250"],
    ["Annual electricity (stove)", "$60-$90", "Included above", "Included above", "Included above", "Included above"],
    ["10-year fuel + maintenance", "$12,600-$27,400", "$9,000-$20,500", "$17,000-$34,000", "$15,000-$40,000", "$7,000-$16,500"],
    ["10-year total (all costs)", "$15,300-$34,900", "$12,000-$27,500", "$20,500-$42,000", "$15,700-$43,000", "$12,000-$27,000"]
  ]}
/>

**The bottom line on 10-year cost:** Pellet stoves compete well against oil furnaces and electric resistance heat, but they're generally more expensive than natural gas furnaces and heat pumps over a 10-year period when you include purchase, installation, and maintenance. Where pellet stoves win decisively is in homes without access to natural gas (common in rural areas) where propane and oil are the alternatives.

## Maintenance Costs Breakdown

Unlike electric fireplaces, pellet stoves require ongoing maintenance. Here is what to budget:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Maintenance Item", "Frequency", "DIY Cost", "Professional Cost"]}
  rows={[
    ["Burn pot cleaning", "Weekly", "$0 (included in routine)", "-"],
    ["Ash pan emptying", "1-2x per week", "$0", "-"],
    ["Glass cleaning", "Weekly", "$5-$10/year (cleaner)", "-"],
    ["Firebox vacuuming", "Monthly", "$0 (shop vac)", "-"],
    ["Heat exchanger cleaning", "Annually", "$0 (DIY tools)", "$150-$250"],
    ["Vent pipe inspection/cleaning", "Annually", "$20-$40 (brush kit)", "$100-$200"],
    ["Door gasket replacement", "Every 2-3 years", "$20-$40 (gasket)", "$75-$125"],
    ["Igniter replacement", "Every 3-5 years", "$30-$80 (part)", "$100-$175"],
    ["Combustion fan replacement", "Every 5-8 years", "$80-$150 (part)", "$175-$300"],
    ["Auger motor replacement", "Every 8-12 years", "$100-$200 (part)", "$200-$350"],
    ["Annual professional service", "Annually", "-", "$150-$300"]
  ]}
/>

**Annual maintenance budget: $150 to $400 per year,** depending on whether you do routine cleaning yourself (recommended) and hire a professional for the annual deep service (also recommended). DIY-savvy owners can reduce costs to $100 to $200/year by doing most maintenance themselves and only calling a pro every other year.

**Real-world example 5 - Maintenance reality check:** A homeowner tracked all pellet stove maintenance costs over 5 years with a Quadra-Fire Mt. Vernon AE. Year 1: $200 (annual service only). Year 2: $200 (service) + $35 (gasket) = $235. Year 3: $200 (service) + $65 (igniter) = $265. Year 4: $200 (service only). Year 5: $200 (service) + $35 (gasket) + $120 (combustion fan) = $355. Five-year average: $251/year. Not cheap, but predictable.

## How Stove Efficiency Affects Your Costs

Stove efficiency directly determines how much of the energy in your pellets becomes useful heat versus waste. A 10 percent improvement in efficiency saves you 10 percent on fuel.

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Stove Efficiency", "Pellets Needed (per season, 1,800 sq ft, Zone 5)", "Fuel Cost (at $280/ton)", "Annual Savings vs. 70% Efficiency"]}
  rows={[
    ["70% (older/budget models)", "4.3 tons", "$1,204", "Baseline"],
    ["75% (average)", "4.0 tons", "$1,120", "$84/year"],
    ["80% (good)", "3.75 tons", "$1,050", "$154/year"],
    ["83% (very good - Harman)", "3.6 tons", "$1,008", "$196/year"],
    ["86% (excellent - Comfortbilt claimed)", "3.5 tons", "$980", "$224/year"]
  ]}
/>

Over a 15-year stove lifespan, the fuel savings from a high-efficiency stove add up. A stove operating at 83 percent efficiency versus 70 percent saves approximately $2,940 in fuel over 15 years. This is why spending $2,000 more on a high-efficiency Harman versus a budget model often pays for itself through reduced fuel consumption alone.

## Money-Saving Strategies

**1. Buy pellets in bulk during spring/summer.** A 3-ton order in June typically costs 10 to 15 percent less than buying bags individually during winter. That is $84 to $126 in savings on a 3-ton purchase.

**2. Use the thermostat.** Letting the stove cycle between high and low based on room temperature uses 20 to 30 percent less fuel than running it continuously on medium. The stove idles on low when the room reaches target temp, then ramps up when it drops.

**3. Seal and insulate.** Every air leak and insulation gap means your stove works harder. Weather-stripping windows ($50 to $100 DIY) and adding attic insulation ($500 to $1,500) can reduce heating demand by 15 to 30 percent, directly cutting pellet consumption.

**4. Use ceiling fans.** A ceiling fan on low speed (clockwise in winter) pushes warm air pooling at the ceiling back down to the living space. This simple trick can reduce the stove's run time by 10 to 15 percent in rooms with 8-foot-plus ceilings.

**5. Zone heat strategically.** If your pellet stove heats the main living area, close doors to unused rooms and let those spaces stay cooler. A 2,200 sq ft home effectively becomes a 1,200 sq ft heating zone, cutting pellet usage nearly in half.

**6. Maintain your stove religiously.** A dirty heat exchanger can reduce efficiency by 10 to 20 percent. Weekly burn-pot cleaning and monthly firebox vacuuming keep the stove operating at peak efficiency throughout the season.

**7. Claim the federal tax credit.** High-efficiency pellet stoves (75 percent or above, HHV) qualify for a 26 percent federal tax credit under the IRA's Section 25D. On a $4,500 installed stove, that is $1,170 back on your taxes. This does not reduce operating costs, but it significantly reduces your effective purchase price and shortens the payback period.

## Power Outage Considerations

Since pellet stoves require electricity, you need a plan for power outages. Options include:

**Battery backup systems ($200 to $500):** Dedicated pellet stove battery backups can run the stove for 8 to 24 hours depending on battery capacity and stove wattage. The Minuteman or CyberPower UPS systems designed for 300W-plus loads work well. Make sure the battery's watt-hour rating exceeds your stove's draw multiplied by desired run hours.

**Portable generator ($400 to $1,200):** A 2,000W inverter generator provides clean power for the stove plus basic household needs. Pellet stoves typically draw 150 to 300W during operation, so even a small generator has headroom. Always operate generators outdoors and away from windows.

**Gravity-fed wood stove as backup:** Some households maintain a small wood stove or space heater as a backup that requires no electricity. This belt-and-suspenders approach ensures you are never without heat.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How many bags of pellets does a stove burn per day?",
      answer: "Most homeowners burn 1 to 3 bags (40 to 120 lbs) per day depending on outdoor temperature, home size, insulation, and stove setting. A 1,500 sq ft home in a cold climate typically uses 2 to 2.5 bags per day on average across the season. On the coldest days, consumption can spike to 3 to 4 bags, while mild days may require only 1 bag."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does a ton of pellets cost in 2026?",
      answer: "Premium PFI-certified pellets cost $250 to $310 per ton in 2026, with a national average around $280/ton. Prices are lowest in the Pacific Northwest ($230 to $270) and highest in the Northeast ($260 to $310). Standard grade pellets run $200 to $250/ton. Buying in spring or summer can save 10 to 15 percent versus winter pricing."
    },
    {
      question: "Is a pellet stove cheaper to run than natural gas?",
      answer: "It depends on your local gas prices. Pellet fuel costs $14 to $19 per million BTU of useful heat, while natural gas costs $10 to $15 per million BTU at typical rates. In areas with cheap natural gas (under $1.00/therm), gas is cheaper. In areas with expensive gas (above $1.30/therm) or no gas service, pellets often win. Pellet stoves also qualify for tax credits that gas furnaces do not."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does pellet stove maintenance cost per year?",
      answer: "Budget $150 to $400 per year for maintenance. This includes annual professional service ($150 to $300), plus occasional parts like door gaskets ($20 to $40 every 2 to 3 years), igniters ($30 to $80 every 3 to 5 years), and cleaning supplies ($20 to $30/year). DIY-handy owners can reduce this to $100 to $200 by doing routine maintenance themselves."
    },
    {
      question: "How much electricity does a pellet stove use?",
      answer: "A pellet stove draws 145 to 315 watts during active operation, powering the auger motor, combustion blower, convection fan, and control board. Running 10 to 14 hours per day, this translates to 1.5 to 4.4 kWh daily, or $8 to $12 per month at the national average electricity rate. The electric igniter draws 300 to 400W but only operates for 5 to 10 minutes per startup."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it cheaper to burn pellets or firewood?",
      answer: "On a cost-per-BTU basis, they are similar. Premium pellets cost $14 to $19 per million BTU while cordwood costs $10 to $25 per million BTU depending on species and region. The real cost difference is in labor and convenience. Pellets are delivered, stored in bags, and auto-fed by the stove. Cordwood requires splitting, stacking, carrying, and manual loading. If you value your time, pellets are cheaper overall."
    },
    {
      question: "How many tons of pellets do I need for a winter?",
      answer: "Most homeowners burn 2 to 5 tons per heating season. A 1,200 sq ft home in Zone 4 needs about 2 to 2.5 tons. A 1,800 sq ft home in Zone 5 needs 3 to 4 tons. A 2,500 sq ft home in Zone 6 needs 4.5 to 6 tons. Buy 10 percent extra as a buffer for unexpectedly cold stretches. At $280/ton, that is $560 to $1,680 for the season in fuel."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I save money by mixing premium and standard pellets?",
      answer: "Some homeowners mix premium and standard pellets 50/50 to reduce costs by about $1.50 to $2.00 per ton while maintaining acceptable ash levels. However, this is not recommended for all stoves. Harman and Quadra-Fire stoves with automatic combustion adjustment handle mixed fuel well. Budget stoves without auto-adjustment may struggle with inconsistent fuel quality. Check your manual before mixing."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the payback period for a pellet stove?",
      answer: "Payback depends on what fuel you are replacing. Switching from propane ($2,800/year) to pellets ($1,400/year) saves $1,400/year, giving a 2 to 3 year payback on a $3,500 installed stove. Switching from natural gas ($1,200/year) to pellets ($1,400/year) may never pay back on fuel savings alone. The best payback scenarios involve replacing propane or heating oil in cold climates."
    },

      question: "Does a pellet stove add value to your home?",
      answer: "A well-installed pellet stove can add $2,000 to $5,000 in home value according to hearth industry surveys, particularly in rural areas and cold climates where buyers appreciate independent heating options. The Hearth, Patio and Barbecue Association reports that 70 percent of home buyers in cold-climate regions consider a fireplace or stove a desirable feature. However, a poorly installed or outdated stove can be a liability during home inspections."
