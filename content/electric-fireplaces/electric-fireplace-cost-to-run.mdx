# How Much Does an Electric Fireplace Cost to Run?

An electric fireplace costs **$0.25 per hour on high** (1,500W) and **$0.13 per hour on low** (750W) at the national average electricity rate of $0.168/kWh. That works out to **$37.80 per month** if you run it 5 hours per day on high, or **$18.90 per month** on low. Your actual cost depends on your local electricity rate, which ranges from $0.11/kWh in Louisiana to $0.39/kWh in Hawaii.

This article breaks down the exact operating costs for every usage pattern, compares costs across all 50 states, and shows you how electric fireplaces stack up against gas, wood, and pellet alternatives on a cost-per-BTU basis.

<TableOfContents />

## The Simple Formula

Calculating your electric fireplace cost is straightforward:

**Cost per hour = (Wattage ÷ 1,000) × Electricity Rate**

For a standard 1,500W electric fireplace:
- **High (1,500W):** 1.5 kW × $0.168/kWh = **$0.252/hour**
- **Low (750W):** 0.75 kW × $0.168/kWh = **$0.126/hour**
- **Flame only (no heat):** 0.05 kW × $0.168/kWh = **$0.008/hour**

That's the math. The rest of this article helps you understand how your specific situation — your state, your usage pattern, your home — changes these numbers.

<Callout type="info">
**Why are all electric fireplaces 1,500W?** It's not a coincidence — it's the National Electrical Code. Standard 120V household outlets are on 15-amp circuits, which have an 1,800W maximum. The NEC requires a 20% safety margin for continuous loads (devices running 3+ hours), which caps appliances at 1,440W. Manufacturers round to 1,500W since brief operation slightly above 1,440W is acceptable. This means every plug-in electric fireplace, space heater, and portable radiator in the U.S. produces the same 5,118 BTU of heat.

## Cost Per Hour by State (2026)

Your local electricity rate is the single biggest variable in your operating cost. Here's what a 1,500W electric fireplace costs per hour in every region, using January 2026 EIA data:

## Monthly and Annual Cost Breakdown

Here's what to expect based on common usage patterns at the national average rate ($0.168/kWh):

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Usage Pattern", "Setting", "Hours/Day", "Monthly Cost", "Heating Season (5 mo)", "Annual Cost"]}

*\*Assumes heating use only during 5-month winter season (November–March).*
*\*\*Assumes year-round decorative use (12 months).*

**Real-world example #1 — Zone heating strategy:** A family in Ohio ($0.152/kWh) runs their electric fireplace on high (1,500W) for 4 hours every evening while watching TV. They simultaneously lower their gas furnace thermostat from 70°F to 65°F. The fireplace costs $27.36/month, but the 5°F thermostat reduction saves them approximately $45/month on their gas bill (DOE estimates 3% savings per degree). Net savings: $17.64/month — the fireplace actually pays for itself.

**Real-world example #2 — Apartment heating:** A renter in New York City ($0.224/kWh) uses an electric fireplace as their primary heat source in a well-insulated 400 sq ft studio. Running on high 8 hours/day costs $80.64/month. Their radiator heat (included in rent) handles the baseline, so the fireplace provides the extra warmth they need without any additional utility cost if they're strategic about timing.

## Electric Fireplace vs. Space Heater: Same Cost, Different Value

Here's a fact that surprises many people: a $200 space heater and a $1,000 electric fireplace cost exactly the same to operate per hour. Both draw 1,500W and produce 5,118 BTU. The differences are in the experience.

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Factor", "Electric Fireplace", "Space Heater"]}
  rows={[
    ["Operating cost (1,500W)", "$0.25/hr", "$0.25/hr"],
    ["BTU output", "5,118", "5,118"],
    ["Visual appeal", "Flame ambiance (year-round value)", "None"],
    ["Safety features", "Cool glass, auto-off, tip-over, timer", "Varies widely by model"],
    ["Noise level", "Near-silent (fan only on heat mode)", "Fan noise, clicking"],
    ["Portability", "Fixed (wall or floor)", "Portable"],
    ["Upfront cost", "$200–$1,400", "$25–$200"],
    ["Lifespan", "10–20 years", "3–5 years"],
    ["Resale value impact", "Positive (adds ambiance)", "None"],
    ["Year-round use", "Yes (flame-only mode)", "No (heating only)"]
  ]}
/>

The practical conclusion: if you're going to run a 1,500W heater in a room anyway, an electric fireplace delivers the same heat plus visual ambiance for the same operating cost. The only premium is the upfront purchase price, which averages out to $50–$100/year over the fireplace's lifespan.

## Electric Fireplace vs. Gas Fireplace: Cost Comparison

Gas fireplaces produce 4–8x more heat but also cost more to install and maintain. Here's how the total cost of ownership compares:

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Cost Category", "Electric Fireplace", "Gas Fireplace (Direct Vent)"]}
  rows={[
    ["Purchase price", "$200–$1,400", "$2,000–$5,500"],
    ["Installation", "$0–$500", "$1,500–$3,500"],
    ["Fuel cost per hour (high)", "$0.25/hr (electricity)", "$0.35–$0.70/hr (natural gas)"],
    ["BTU output (high)", "5,118 BTU/hr", "25,000–40,000 BTU/hr"],
    ["Cost per 100,000 BTU", "$4.89", "$1.00–$2.50"],
    ["Annual maintenance", "$0", "$150–$300 (cleaning + inspection)"],
    ["Chimney/vent cleaning", "$0", "$100–$250/year"],
    ["Monthly cost (3 hrs/day)", "$22.68", "$31.50–$63.00"],
    ["5-year total cost", "$1,500–$2,800", "$5,800–$12,500"],
    ["10-year total cost", "$2,800–$4,200", "$9,100–$19,500"]
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip">
**When electric wins on cost:** If you need supplemental heat for a single room (under 400 sq ft) and value zero-maintenance operation, electric is the clear cost winner. The lower upfront cost, zero maintenance, and identical zone-heating effectiveness make it the better financial choice for most homeowners who don't need whole-room heating of 500+ sq ft.

**When gas wins on cost:** If you need to heat 500+ sq ft or want a primary heating source, gas produces far more heat per dollar. At $1.00–$2.50 per 100,000 BTU versus $4.89 for electric, gas delivers roughly 2–5x more heat per dollar spent on fuel.

## Electric Fireplace vs. Pellet Stove: Cost Comparison

<ComparisonTable
  headers={["Cost Category", "Electric Fireplace", "Pellet Stove"]}
  rows={[
    ["Purchase price", "$200–$1,400", "$1,500–$4,300"],
    ["Installation", "$0–$500", "$1,200–$3,000"],
    ["Fuel cost per million BTU", "$33–$55 (electricity)", "$14–$19 (pellets)"],
    ["Max BTU output", "5,118 BTU/hr", "8,000–70,000 BTU/hr"],
    ["Annual maintenance", "$0", "$150–$400"],
    ["Monthly fuel (5 hrs/day)", "$37.80 (electric)", "$100–$400 (pellets + electric)"],
    ["Heats whole house?", "No (single room only)", "Yes (with adequate BTU)"],
    ["Requires fuel storage?", "No", "Yes (bags of pellets)"],
    ["Power outage operation?", "No", "No (needs battery backup)"]
  ]}
/>

The bottom line: pellet stoves cost significantly less per BTU of heat produced, but they come with higher upfront costs, ongoing maintenance, and the logistics of fuel storage and delivery. Electric fireplaces are the low-hassle, low-commitment option for supplemental room heating.

## How to Calculate Your Exact Cost

Use this formula with your actual electricity rate (found on your utility bill):

**Monthly cost = (Wattage ÷ 1,000) × Hours per day × 30 × Your rate per kWh**

**Examples:**

**Example 1 — California homeowner, moderate use:**
(1,500 ÷ 1,000) × 4 hours × 30 days × $0.296 = **$53.28/month**

**Example 2 — Texas renter, light use:**
(750 ÷ 1,000) × 3 hours × 30 days × $0.138 = **$9.32/month**

**Example 3 — Maine homeowner, heavy use:**
(1,500 ÷ 1,000) × 8 hours × 30 days × $0.208 = **$74.88/month**

**Example 4 — Florida decorator, flame only:**
(50 ÷ 1,000) × 6 hours × 30 days × $0.144 = **$1.30/month**

<Callout type="tip">
**Find your exact rate:** Look at your electric bill for the line item called "energy charge" or "per kWh rate." Ignore delivery charges and taxes — those are already baked into the total. If your bill shows only total charges, divide the total electric bill by total kWh used. That's your all-in rate, which is what matters for this calculation.

## 7 Ways to Reduce Your Electric Fireplace Operating Cost

**1. Use the thermostat aggressively.** Set the fireplace thermostat to your desired temperature. Once the room reaches that temperature, the heating element cycles off while flames continue. This can reduce effective wattage from 1,500W to 500–800W averaged over an evening.

**2. Run on low when possible.** The 750W setting produces half the heat at half the cost. In well-insulated rooms under 250 sq ft, low is often sufficient to maintain a comfortable 68–72°F.

**3. Zone heat and thermostat down.** Run the fireplace in your living room and lower your central thermostat by 3–5°F. The DOE estimates 3% savings per degree on your heating bill. If your furnace costs $200/month, dropping 5°F saves $30/month — more than covering the fireplace's electricity cost.

**4. Use a smart plug for scheduling.** A Wi-Fi smart plug ($15–$25) lets you schedule exact on/off times. Set it to turn on 15 minutes before you get home and off at bedtime. Eliminating even 30 minutes of unnecessary run time saves $3.78/month at the national average rate.

**5. Seal the room.** Close doors and windows in the room where the fireplace is operating. A 1,500W heater in a sealed 300 sq ft room is far more effective than in an open floor plan where heat dissipates into adjacent spaces.

**6. Use flame-only mode after heating.** Once the room is warm, switch to flame-only mode. The ambient heat in the room takes time to dissipate, and you keep the visual ambiance for just pennies per hour.

**7. Consider time-of-use rates.** If your utility offers time-of-use pricing, run your fireplace during off-peak hours (typically 9 PM–6 AM) when rates can be 30–50% lower. Evening fireplace use often aligns perfectly with the beginning of off-peak periods.

## Annual Cost Scenarios: Is It Worth It?

Let's run the numbers on three common scenarios to see if an electric fireplace makes financial sense:

**Scenario A — Replacing a space heater:**
You already use a 1,500W space heater 4 hours/day during winter (5 months). An electric fireplace costs the same to operate ($0.25/hr) but looks dramatically better and is safer. If you spend $500 on a Touchstone Sideline and your space heater was going to last 3 more years ($60 replacement value), you're paying $440 extra for 10–15 years of flame ambiance. That's $29–$44/year for a significant quality-of-life upgrade.

**Scenario B — Adding supplemental heat to a cold room:**
Your living room is always 3–5°F cooler than the rest of the house. Running an electric fireplace 4 hours/evening on high costs $30.24/month (national average). Over a 5-month winter, that's $151.20. A $700 fireplace amortized over 15 years adds $46.67/year. Total annual cost: approximately $198 for a comfortable, attractive living room.

**Scenario C — Zone heating to save on furnace costs:**
You run a gas furnace at 70°F costing $250/month in winter. By adding a $500 electric fireplace to your main living area and dropping the thermostat to 65°F, you save approximately $37.50/month on gas (15% reduction). The fireplace costs $30.24/month to run. Net monthly savings: $7.26. The fireplace pays for itself in 69 months (5.75 years) while providing ambiance.

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Key Takeaways:**
- An electric fireplace costs $0.25/hour on high (1,500W) at the national average rate of $0.168/kWh.
- Monthly costs range from $7.56 (light use, low setting) to $90.72 (heavy use, high setting) at the national average.
- Your state's electricity rate is the biggest cost variable — costs range from $24/month in Louisiana to $87/month in Hawaii for the same usage.
- Electric fireplaces and space heaters cost exactly the same to operate — both draw 1,500W.
- Flame-only mode costs just $1–$2/month, making year-round decorative use essentially free.
- Zone heating (fireplace on, thermostat down 5°F) can result in net energy savings of $5–$15/month.
- Electric fireplaces cost 2–5x more per BTU than gas or pellets, but excel as zero-maintenance supplemental heaters.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to run an electric fireplace per hour?",
      answer: "At the national average electricity rate of $0.168/kWh, an electric fireplace costs $0.25 per hour on high (1,500W) and $0.13 per hour on low (750W). Flame-only mode with no heating costs less than $0.01 per hour. Your local rate may differ — multiply 1.5 kW by your per-kWh rate to get your exact cost."
    },
    {
      question: "Does an electric fireplace use a lot of electricity?",
      answer: "On heat mode, an electric fireplace uses 1,500W — the same as a space heater, hair dryer, or toaster oven. Running it 5 hours daily adds roughly 225 kWh to your monthly bill (about 23% of the average U.S. household's 886 kWh monthly usage). On flame-only mode, it uses just 40–70W — less than a standard light bulb."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it cheaper to run an electric fireplace or central heat?",
      answer: "It depends on what you're heating. For a single room (under 400 sq ft), an electric fireplace is often cheaper because you can lower the central thermostat. For a whole house, central heat (especially gas or heat pump) is much cheaper per BTU. The DOE recommends zone heating with electric heaters while reducing central heat by 3–5°F for optimal savings."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does an electric fireplace add to your electric bill?",
      answer: "Running an electric fireplace 5 hours daily on high adds approximately $37.80/month to your electric bill at the national average rate. That's $189 over a 5-month winter heating season. On low (750W), the addition is roughly $18.90/month or $94.50 per season. Flame-only mode adds just $1.50/month."
    },
    {
      question: "Are electric fireplaces cheaper than gas fireplaces to run?",
      answer: "Electric fireplaces are cheaper per hour ($0.25 vs. $0.35–$0.70 for gas), but gas fireplaces produce 4–8x more heat. On a cost-per-BTU basis, natural gas is roughly 2–5x cheaper. Electric wins on total cost when you factor in zero maintenance ($0/year vs. $150–$300/year for gas) and much lower installation costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Do electric fireplaces raise your home insurance?",
      answer: "No. Electric fireplaces typically do not increase home insurance premiums because they involve no combustion, no gas line, and no chimney. In fact, some insurers view the removal of a wood-burning fireplace in favor of an electric model as a risk reduction. Always notify your insurance company when installing or removing any fireplace, but rate increases are extremely rare for electric models."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe to run an electric fireplace 24/7?",
      answer: "While UL-certified electric fireplaces are designed for safe continuous operation, most manufacturers recommend against running heat mode unattended or overnight. Flame-only mode (no heating elements active) is safe for continuous operation. If you want extended run times, use the built-in thermostat and timer features to manage heat cycling and auto-shutoff."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to run an electric fireplace in California?",
      answer: "California has some of the highest electricity rates in the continental U.S., averaging $0.296/kWh in 2026. Running a 1,500W electric fireplace on high for 5 hours daily costs approximately $66.60/month in California — nearly double the national average. On low (750W), it's about $33.30/month. This makes zone heating strategy even more important for California residents."
    },
    {
      question: "Do electric fireplaces use more electricity than TV?",
      answer: "On heat mode, yes — significantly. A 1,500W electric fireplace uses about 25x more electricity than a 55-inch LED TV (which uses about 60W). However, on flame-only mode (40–70W), an electric fireplace uses roughly the same electricity as a TV. Running both together costs about $0.26/hour on heat mode or $0.02/hour with flame-only."
    },
    {
      question: "Are infrared electric fireplaces cheaper to run than regular ones?",
      answer: "No. Infrared electric fireplaces and standard fan-forced electric fireplaces both draw 1,500W and cost the same to operate ($0.25/hour at national average). The difference is in how the heat is distributed — infrared heats objects directly while fan-forced heats the air. Some users report feeling warmer with infrared at lower settings, which could reduce costs if you run on low more often."
