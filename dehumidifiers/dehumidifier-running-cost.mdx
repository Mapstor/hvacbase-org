# How Much Does It Cost to Run a Dehumidifier? (2026 Calculator)

Running a dehumidifier costs between $3 and $60 per month, depending on the unit's wattage, how many hours it runs daily, and your local electricity rate. At the 2026 national average of $0.17/kWh, a typical 50-pint ENERGY STAR dehumidifier running 10 hours/day costs about $25 per month — or roughly $0.83/day.

Use the calculator below to find your exact cost, then read on for a complete breakdown by unit type, state-by-state electricity rates, and five strategies to cut your dehumidifier's energy bill by up to 30%.

## Dehumidifier Running Cost Calculator

<CalcWrapper type="dehumidifier-cost" />

## The Running Cost Formula

The math is straightforward. Here's the formula every HVAC tech uses:

**Daily cost = (Watts ÷ 1,000) × Hours per day × Electricity rate ($/kWh)**

For example, a 550-watt dehumidifier running 10 hours at $0.17/kWh:
- (550 ÷ 1,000) × 10 × $0.17 = **$0.94/day**
- Monthly (30 days): **$28.05**
- Annually (6 months of use): **$168.30**

<Callout type="tip">
Most homeowners only run dehumidifiers 5–7 months per year — typically May through October in humid climates. Your actual annual cost is usually half of what a "12-month" calculation would suggest.

## Real-World Cost Examples

### Example 1: Moderate Basement in Columbus, OH

**Setup:** Frigidaire 50-pint (515W), basement is 1,100 sq ft, moderately damp in summer.
**Runtime:** Unit cycles on for about 8 hours/day from June through September.
**Local rate:** $0.14/kWh
**Monthly cost:** (515 ÷ 1,000) × 8 × $0.14 × 30 = **$17.34/month**
**Seasonal total (4 months):** **$69.36**

### Example 2: Wet Basement in New Orleans, LA

**Setup:** 70-pint portable (720W), basement is 1,500 sq ft, consistently 70–80% RH from May to October.
**Runtime:** Runs about 14 hours/day in peak summer, averaging 11 hours/day over the season.
**Local rate:** $0.12/kWh
**Monthly cost:** (720 ÷ 1,000) × 11 × $0.12 × 30 = **$28.51/month**
**Seasonal total (6 months):** **$171.07**

### Example 3: Whole-House in Jacksonville, FL

**Setup:** AprilAire E100 (830W) ducted into HVAC system, 2,600 sq ft home.
**Runtime:** Runs 5–7 hours/day from April to October. Averaging 6 hours.

**Seasonal total (3 months):** **$62.64**

## What Affects Running Cost the Most?

Five factors determine your actual dehumidifier operating cost. Here they are ranked by impact:

### 1. Hours of Operation (Biggest Factor)

A unit running 16 hours/day costs 60% more than the same unit running 10 hours. The biggest lever you have is reducing how long the dehumidifier needs to run. Sealing air leaks, fixing water intrusion, and proper sizing all reduce runtime.

### 2. Wattage (Unit Efficiency)

A 50-pint unit can draw anywhere from 480W (highly efficient) to 600W (average). Over a 6-month season at 10 hours/day, that 120W difference costs you $37 in electricity at $0.17/kWh. Choose ENERGY STAR certified models with the highest IEF rating you can find.

### 3. Electricity Rate

You can't control your utility's rate, but you can run the dehumidifier during off-peak hours if your utility offers time-of-use (TOU) pricing. Off-peak rates can be 30–50% lower than peak rates.

### 4. Target Humidity Setting

Setting your dehumidifier to 40% instead of 50% forces it to run significantly longer. Each 5% lower target adds roughly 15–25% more runtime. Set it to 50% for most spaces — that's the EPA threshold for mold and dust mite control.

### 5. Room Conditions

A sealed room reaches target humidity faster. Air leaks, open windows, and active water intrusion force the unit to work continuously. Fix the moisture source first.

## 5 Ways to Cut Dehumidifier Running Costs by 30%

### 1. Buy ENERGY STAR Certified

ENERGY STAR dehumidifiers are 15–30% more efficient than standard models. The extra $20–$50 upfront pays for itself within the first season. Look for the highest IEF rating in your capacity class.

### 2. Size Up, Not Down

A 50-pint unit in a space that needs 35 pints reaches target humidity faster and cycles off sooner. Total runtime drops, often by 25–40%. The slightly higher wattage is more than offset by fewer operating hours.

### 3. Set the Humidistat to 50%

Don't set it to 35% or 40% "just to be safe." The EPA says 30–50% is healthy. Setting to 50% instead of 40% can reduce daily runtime by 3–5 hours, saving $8–$15/month.

### 4. Seal the Space

Air-seal your basement or crawl space. Caulk around windows, seal rim joists, and close foundation vents (for conditioned crawl spaces). Every cubic foot of humid outdoor air that leaks in is extra moisture your dehumidifier has to remove.

### 5. Use Continuous Drainage

When a bucket-full shutoff stops the unit for 6–8 hours overnight, humidity rebounds. The unit then works harder and longer to bring levels back down. Continuous drainage keeps the dehumidifier running only when needed, without recovery surges.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run a dehumidifier 24 hours a day?",
    answer: "At the national average of $0.17/kWh, a 50-pint dehumidifier (500W) running 24/7 costs $2.04/day or $61.20/month. A 70-pint unit (720W) costs $2.94/day or $88.13/month. However, a properly sized dehumidifier in a sealed space shouldn't need to run 24/7 — if it does, it's likely undersized, the space has active water intrusion, or significant air leaks are letting humid air in continuously."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it cheaper to run a dehumidifier or AC?",
    answer: "For humidity control alone, a dehumidifier is far cheaper. A 50-pint dehumidifier uses 480-550 watts, while a central AC uses 2,000-5,000 watts. However, if you need cooling AND dehumidification, the AC handles both. A dehumidifier supplements the AC only when humidity remains above 55% despite cooling."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a dehumidifier increase my electric bill significantly?",
    answer: "A typical 50-pint ENERGY STAR dehumidifier adds $19-$28/month to your electric bill during humid months, which is roughly 5-10% of an average household's total electricity cost. For comparison, that's less than running a single 100W light bulb for 10 hours a day. It's a modest cost that prevents thousands of dollars in potential mold remediation."
  },
  {
    question: "How many hours a day should a dehumidifier run?",
    answer: "Let the humidistat decide. Set your target to 50% RH and let the unit cycle automatically. In a properly sized and sealed space, the unit typically runs 8-12 hours/day during peak humidity season. If it's running 20+ hours/day, either the unit is too small, the space has major air leaks, or there's active water intrusion that needs fixing."
  },
  {
    question: "What uses more electricity — a dehumidifier or a space heater?",
    answer: "A space heater uses significantly more electricity. A typical 1,500W space heater running 8 hours/day costs about $6.12/day at $0.17/kWh, while a 50-pint dehumidifier (500W) running 10 hours costs about $0.85/day. The dehumidifier uses roughly 7 times less electricity than a space heater per day."
  },
  {
    question: "Does a dehumidifier cost more at night?",
    answer: "If your utility uses time-of-use (TOU) pricing, running your dehumidifier during off-peak hours (typically 9 PM to 6 AM) can be 30-50% cheaper per kWh. If you have a flat rate, the cost is the same regardless of time. Check your electricity bill or call your utility to see if you have TOU pricing."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a whole-house dehumidifier cost to operate?",
    answer: "Whole-house ducted dehumidifiers (80-120 pints/day) typically cost $22-$28/month to operate. Despite higher wattage (750-900W), they run fewer hours per day (4-7 hours vs 10-14 hours for portables) because they process air more efficiently through ductwork. They also reduce AC runtime, which can offset their operating cost by $15-$40/month in humid climates."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth running a dehumidifier in winter?",
    answer: "In most climates, no. Winter heating dries indoor air naturally, often dropping humidity below 30%. Running a dehumidifier in winter wastes electricity on a problem that doesn't exist. Exceptions include enclosed crawl spaces with ground moisture, indoor pool rooms, and homes in mild/wet winter climates (Pacific Northwest) where indoor RH may stay above 55% even in winter."
  },
  {
    question: "How much money can an ENERGY STAR dehumidifier save me?",
    answer: "Compared to a non-certified model of the same capacity, an ENERGY STAR dehumidifier saves approximately $30-$60 per year in electricity. Over a 7-year unit lifespan, that's $210-$420 in savings. Since ENERGY STAR models typically cost only $20-$50 more upfront, the payback period is usually less than one year."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I unplug my dehumidifier when not in use?",
    answer: "Yes. Even in standby mode, a dehumidifier draws 1-5 watts of phantom power, costing $1-$7/year. More importantly, leaving it plugged in during winter in a cold basement risks the compressor trying to start in sub-optimal temperatures. Unplug it at the end of the season, clean it thoroughly, and store it in a dry place."
