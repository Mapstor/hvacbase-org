LGR stands for Low Grain Refrigerant — a technology that achieves lower humidity targets than conventional dehumidifiers. LGR units can bring relative humidity down to 30% and specific humidity to under 40 grains per pound, which is necessary for drying water-damaged structures to IICRC standards.
</Callout>

## Types of Commercial Dehumidifiers

### LGR (Low Grain Refrigerant) Dehumidifiers

LGR dehumidifiers use a two-stage cooling process to achieve lower humidity targets than conventional units. They're the industry standard for water damage restoration because they can dry structures to the 30–40% RH required for proper remediation.

**Best for:** Water damage restoration, mold remediation, flood cleanup.
**Capacity range:** 130–200 pints/day.
**Key feature:** Can achieve specific humidity below 40 grains/lb.

### Conventional Commercial Dehumidifiers

These are heavy-duty versions of residential compressor technology — larger capacity, more durable construction, but not capable of LGR-level drying.

**Best for:** Warehouses, manufacturing, general commercial humidity control.
**Capacity range:** 150–350 pints/day.
**Key feature:** Lower cost per pint of capacity than LGR.

### Desiccant Commercial Dehumidifiers

Commercial desiccant units use large silica gel wheels for extreme low-temperature and low-humidity applications. They can operate in near-freezing conditions and achieve very low humidity targets.

**Best for:** Cold storage, archives, museums, pharmaceutical facilities.
**Capacity range:** 50–500+ pints/day.
**Key feature:** Operate effectively from 33°F to 100°F.

### Pool/Natatorium Dehumidifiers

Specialized units designed for indoor pools, spas, and aquatic facilities. They handle the extreme continuous moisture load from evaporating pool water and often include fresh-air ventilation and heat recovery.

**Best for:** Indoor pools, spas, water parks, natatoriums.
**Capacity range:** 200–1,000+ pints/day.
**Key feature:** Corrosion-resistant components for chlorinated environments.

For water damage restoration, IICRC S500 standards specify using psychrometric calculations — not square footage — to size dehumidification. You measure the target grains per pound, the current grain depression, and the class of water damage to determine the required dehumidifier capacity. Restoration contractors use specialized software (like Dri-Eaz's DryCog) for these calculations.
</Callout>

## Real-World Applications

### Application 1: Water Damage Restoration (2,000 sq ft Home)

**Scenario:** Burst pipe flooded a single-story home. Category 1 (clean water), Class 3 (water affects walls and subfloor). Goal: dry structure to IICRC standards within 3–5 days.

**Equipment:** 2× AlorAir Storm LGR Extreme units, 6× axial air movers.

**Process:** LGR dehumidifiers run 24/7, targeting 40 GPP specific humidity. Air movers create high-velocity airflow across wet surfaces. Daily monitoring with moisture meters and thermo-hygrometers.

**Result:** Structure dried to acceptable moisture content in 4 days. Total dehumidifier runtime: 192 hours per unit.

### Application 2: Indoor Pool Room (Pool: 20×40 ft)

**Scenario:** New indoor pool in a residential facility. Pool room is 3,500 sq ft with 12-foot ceilings. Constant evaporation creates humidity issues.

**Equipment:** AlorAir Sentinel HDi120 × 2, ducted to pool room, with fresh-air intake.

**Process:** Units run continuously, targeting 55–60% RH (comfortable for swimmers, prevents condensation on structure). Condensate pumped to pool room floor drain.

**Result:** Humidity maintained at 55–58% year-round. No condensation on windows or ceiling. Annual operating cost: approximately $1,200 in electricity.

### Application 3: Warehouse Storage (30,000 sq ft)

**Scenario:** Distribution warehouse storing electronics and paper goods. Summer humidity causes condensation on metal racking and risks product damage.

**Equipment:** 3× Dri-Eaz DrizAir 1200 units positioned throughout the warehouse.

**Process:** Units set to 50% RH, run May through October. Condensate drains to floor drains via gravity.

**Result:** Warehouse humidity maintained at 48–52%. No product damage reported. Total seasonal operating cost: approximately $3,000.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ questions={[
  {
    question: "What is an LGR dehumidifier?",
    answer: "LGR (Low Grain Refrigerant) dehumidifiers use a two-stage cooling process to achieve lower humidity targets than conventional units. They pre-cool incoming air, then pass it over the evaporator coils, allowing them to extract more moisture and reach specific humidity levels below 40 grains per pound. This is essential for professional water damage restoration."
  },
  {
    question: "How many commercial dehumidifiers do I need for water damage?",
    answer: "The IICRC S500 standard provides calculation methods based on the Class of water damage and the volume of the affected area. As a rough guide: Class 1-2 water damage in a 1,500 sq ft area typically needs 1-2 LGR units. Class 3-4 damage (affecting structural materials) in the same area might need 2-3 LGR units plus extensive air movement. Restoration contractors use psychrometric calculations for precise sizing."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between commercial and restoration dehumidifiers?",
    answer: "Restoration dehumidifiers are a subset of commercial units, specifically designed for temporary deployment at water damage job sites. They feature LGR technology for low humidity targets, rugged portability (wheels, handles), stackability for transport, hour meters for job costing, and durability for rental fleet use. General commercial dehumidifiers prioritize high capacity and 24/7 reliability over portability."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to run a commercial dehumidifier?",
    answer: "A 180-pint commercial dehumidifier drawing 1,000W costs approximately $4.08/day to run 24 hours at $0.17/kWh. Monthly cost for continuous operation: ~$122. For restoration jobs lasting 3-5 days, electricity cost per unit is $12-$20. These costs are typically passed through to insurance claims in restoration work."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use a commercial dehumidifier in my home?",
    answer: "You can, but it's usually overkill and inefficient for typical home use. Commercial units draw 850-1,500W (vs 400-700W for residential) and are designed for extreme conditions. For home basements or crawl spaces, a high-end residential/light commercial unit like the Santa Fe Advance120 is more appropriate than a full restoration-grade LGR."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do commercial dehumidifiers last?",
    answer: "Quality commercial dehumidifiers last 8-15 years or 10,000-20,000+ operating hours with proper maintenance. The compressor is the primary wear item. Regular maintenance includes: cleaning coils monthly, checking refrigerant annually, lubricating motors (if applicable), and ensuring proper airflow. Rental fleet units see harder use and may last 5-8 years."
  },
  {
    question: "What is grain depression and why does it matter?",
    answer: "Grain depression is the difference in specific humidity (measured in grains per pound) between the inlet air and the outlet air of a dehumidifier. A higher grain depression means more effective moisture removal per air pass. LGR dehumidifiers achieve grain depressions of 30-40 grains, while conventional units achieve 15-25 grains. Higher grain depression = faster drying."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a special dehumidifier for an indoor pool?",
    answer: "Yes. Indoor pools create continuous, extreme moisture loads from surface evaporation. Pool-specific dehumidifiers are designed for 24/7 operation, have corrosion-resistant components for chlorinated environments, often include fresh air ventilation, and may feature heat recovery to warm the pool room. Standard commercial dehumidifiers may corrode and fail quickly in pool environments."
