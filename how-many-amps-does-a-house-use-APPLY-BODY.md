# How Many Amps Does a House Use?

"How many amps does a house use" has two answers: how much it draws on average, which is surprisingly little, and how much it can draw at once, which is what the electrical service is sized for. The service rating on your main breaker, often 100, 150 or 200 amps, is the second number.

**An average U.S. home uses about 875 kWh a month (EIA), an average draw of about 1.2 kW, roughly 5 amps at 240 volts. But when the AC, water heater, dryer and range run together, demand climbs into the tens of amps, which is why most homes have 100- to 200-amp service. A 200-amp service can deliver up to 48,000 watts.**

## Average draw vs. peak load

Average power = monthly kWh ÷ hours in a month: 875 kWh ÷ 730 hours is about 1.2 kW. At 240 volts that's about 5 amps. Peaks are far higher, because large appliances come on together, and the service has to carry the peak, not the average.

## What service size means

| Service | Capacity at 240 V |
|---|---|
| 100 amps | 24,000 W |
| 150 amps | 36,000 W |
| 200 amps | 48,000 W |

An electrician sizes service with a load calculation under National Electrical Code Article 220, which accounts for the fact that not everything runs at full power at once. Most newer homes have 200-amp service; older ones often have 100.

## Amps for common appliances

Amps = watts ÷ volts:

| Appliance | Power | Amps |
|---|---|---|
| Space heater | 1,500 W at 120 V | 12.5 A |
| Electric water heater | 4,500 W at 240 V | 18.8 A |
| Electric dryer | 5,000 W at 240 V | 20.8 A |
| 3-ton central AC, while running | about 2.5 kW at 240 V | about 10.5 A |
| Level 2 EV charger | 48 A at 240 V (11.5 kW) | 48 A |

Check each appliance's nameplate for its own rating; motors briefly draw more when starting.

## EV chargers and heat pumps

An EV charger is a continuous load, so the code sizes its circuit at 125% of its current: a 48-amp charger needs a 60-amp circuit. Adding one, or switching from gas to an electric heat pump, water heater or range, is when homes most often outgrow 100-amp service. A load calculation shows whether yours has room.

## When to upgrade the panel

Upgrade when a load calculation shows the service can't carry your planned additions, when breakers trip under normal use, or when an older panel has safety problems. Load management devices that shift or limit big loads can sometimes avoid an upgrade. See the [panel upgrade cost guide](/electrical-panel-upgrade-cost).

## Frequently asked questions

### How many amps does an average house use?

About 5 amps on average at 240 volts, from about 875 kWh a month, but it needs service sized for its peak, typically 100 to 200 amps.

### Is 100-amp service enough?

For a small home with gas heat, cooking and water heating, often yes. Adding an EV charger, a heat pump or other large electric loads often calls for 150 or 200 amps; a load calculation decides.

### How many watts can a 200-amp panel handle?

Up to 48,000 watts at 240 volts, though the load calculation keeps actual demand well below that.

### How do I find my home's amperage?

It's printed on the main breaker at the top of your panel, and usually on the panel label.
