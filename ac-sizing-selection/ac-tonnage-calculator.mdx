# AC Tonnage Calculator Per Square Foot (+Sizing Chart)

**One ton of air conditioning equals 12,000 BTU per hour, and most homes need 1 ton per 400–600 square feet — placing a typical 2,000 sq ft home in the 3–4 ton range.** The exact tonnage depends on your climate zone, insulation quality, and building characteristics, which is why this guide provides detailed sizing charts rather than a single number.

Tonnage is the language contractors speak when quoting central AC systems. Understanding where your home falls on the tonnage chart saves you from the two most expensive sizing mistakes: buying too much capacity (wasting money and getting poor humidity control) or too little (running constantly without reaching setpoint).

<TableOfContents />

## AC Tonnage Chart by Square Footage

This is the most comprehensive tonnage chart available, covering all standard home sizes across five climate zones. Values assume average insulation and 8-foot ceilings.

| Home Size (sq ft) | Zone 2 (Hot) | Zone 3 (Warm) | Zone 4 (Mixed) | Zone 5 (Cool) | Zone 6 (Cold) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 500 | 1 ton | 1 ton | 1 ton | 1 ton | 1 ton |
| 750 | 1.5 ton | 1.5 ton | 1.5 ton | 1 ton | 1 ton |
| 1,000 | 2 ton | 1.5–2 ton | 1.5 ton | 1.5 ton | 1.5 ton |
| 1,200 | 2.5 ton | 2 ton | 2 ton | 1.5–2 ton | 1.5 ton |
| 1,500 | 3 ton | 2.5 ton | 2.5 ton | 2 ton | 2 ton |
| 1,800 | 3.5 ton | 3 ton | 2.5–3 ton | 2.5 ton | 2 ton |
| 2,000 | 3.5–4 ton | 3–3.5 ton | 3 ton | 2.5 ton | 2.5 ton |
| 2,200 | 4 ton | 3.5 ton | 3 ton | 3 ton | 2.5 ton |
| 2,500 | 4.5–5 ton | 4 ton | 3.5 ton | 3 ton | 3 ton |
| 2,800 | 5 ton | 4.5 ton | 4 ton | 3.5 ton | 3 ton |
| 3,000 | 5+ ton | 4.5–5 ton | 4 ton | 3.5 ton | 3–3.5 ton |
| 3,500 | 2-zone | 5 ton | 4.5–5 ton | 4 ton | 3.5 ton |
| 4,000 | 2-zone | 2-zone | 5 ton | 4.5 ton | 4 ton |
| 4,500 | 2-zone | 2-zone | 2-zone | 5 ton | 4.5 ton |
| 5,000 | 2-zone | 2-zone | 2-zone | 2-zone | 5 ton |

<Callout type="info">
**"2-zone" means you need two separate AC systems**, typically one for each floor or wing. Residential AC units max out at 5 tons (60,000 BTU). Homes requiring more than 5 tons of cooling should be divided into zones with separate equipment, which also provides better comfort and redundancy.

## Tonnage to BTU Conversion

| AC Tonnage | BTU/hr | Watts (approximate) | Amps at 240V |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 ton | 12,000 | 880 | 3.7 |
| 1.5 ton | 18,000 | 1,320 | 5.5 |
| 2 ton | 24,000 | 1,760 | 7.3 |
| 2.5 ton | 30,000 | 2,200 | 9.2 |
| 3 ton | 36,000 | 2,640 | 11.0 |
| 3.5 ton | 42,000 | 3,080 | 12.8 |
| 4 ton | 48,000 | 3,520 | 14.7 |
| 5 ton | 60,000 | 4,400 | 18.3 |

*Watts and amps are approximate for SEER2 16 equipment. Higher-efficiency units draw slightly less power per ton.*

## Square Feet Per Ton: The Quick Conversion

If you want to work backwards from tonnage to square footage, here's the rule of thumb by climate:

| Climate | Square Feet Per Ton |
|---|---|
| Hot-humid (Miami, Houston) | 350–450 sq ft per ton |
| Hot-dry (Phoenix, Las Vegas) | 400–500 sq ft per ton |
| Warm (Atlanta, Dallas) | 450–550 sq ft per ton |
| Mixed (Nashville, DC) | 500–600 sq ft per ton |
| Cool (Chicago, Boston) | 550–700 sq ft per ton |
| Cold (Minneapolis, Fargo) | 600–800 sq ft per ton |

These assume average insulation. Well-insulated homes push toward the higher end (more sq ft per ton = smaller system needed). Poorly insulated homes push toward the lower end.

## Step-by-Step Tonnage Calculation

### Method 1: Quick Estimate

**Tonnage = Square footage ÷ Square feet per ton (from table above)**

Example: 2,000 sq ft home in Dallas (warm climate, 500 sq ft per ton)
Tonnage = 2,000 ÷ 500 = 4.0 tons

### Method 2: BTU-Based Calculation

**Tonnage = (Square footage × BTU per sq ft × Adjustment factors) ÷ 12,000**

Example: 2,000 sq ft home in Dallas, average insulation, 9-ft ceilings
BTU = 2,000 × 22 × 1.12 (ceilings) = 49,280 BTU
Tonnage = 49,280 ÷ 12,000 = 4.1 tons → **4-ton system**

### Method 3: Full Load Calculation (Most Accurate)

Use our BTU calculator with all 12 adjustment factors, then divide by 12,000. This gets you within 5–10% of a professional Manual J.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: 1,800 sq ft two-story in Atlanta, GA (Zone 3)**

- BTU calculation: 1,800 × 22 (Zone 3) = 39,600 base
- 9-ft ceilings: × 1.12 = 44,352
- Large windows, partial sun: +10% = 48,787
- Average insulation (2000 build): +0% = 48,787
- Open kitchen: +4,000 = 52,787
- Second floor rooms: included in sq ft
- Duct losses (attic): +15% = 60,705

Tonnage = 60,705 ÷ 12,000 = **5.06 tons → 5-ton system**

Without the adjustment factors, the "quick estimate" would have given 3.5 tons (1,800 ÷ 500) — undersized by 30%.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: 1,200 sq ft new condo in Portland, OR (Zone 4)**

- BTU calculation: 1,200 × 18 (Zone 4, low end for new build) = 21,600 base
- 8-ft ceilings: +0% = 21,600
- Small windows: −5% = 20,520
- Excellent insulation (2024 code): −15% = 17,442
- No kitchen adjustment (small galley): +2,000 = 19,442
- Ducts in conditioned space: −10% = 17,498

Tonnage = 17,498 ÷ 12,000 = **1.46 tons → 1.5-ton system**

This new condo only needs 1.5 tons for 1,200 sq ft. Many contractors would reflexively quote 2.5 tons based on old rules of thumb — oversizing by 67%.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: 3,200 sq ft ranch in Phoenix, AZ (Zone 2)**

- BTU calculation: 3,200 × 28 (Zone 2, high end) = 89,600 base
- 10-ft ceilings: × 1.25 = 112,000
- Massive west-facing windows: +25% = 140,000
- Below-average insulation (1988): +15% = 161,000
- Open kitchen: +4,000 = 165,000
- Slab on grade: +0% = 165,000
- Duct losses: +15% = 189,750
- Dry climate: −10% = 170,775

Tonnage = 170,775 ÷ 12,000 = **14.2 tons → Two-zone system (e.g., 5-ton + 5-ton, or 4-ton + 3.5-ton + supplemental)**

This extreme example shows why Phoenix homes often need oversized or multi-zone systems. The west-facing windows and below-average insulation are the biggest drivers. Window tinting or exterior shading alone could reduce the load by 15–20%.

## Available AC Tonnage Sizes and Models

Residential central air conditioners are manufactured in these standard sizes:

| Tonnage | BTU/hr | Typical Brands/Model Lines (2026) | Approx System Cost (installed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.5 ton | 18,000 | Carrier 24ACC6, Trane XR13, Goodman GSXC7 | $3,000–$5,500 |
| 2 ton | 24,000 | Carrier 24ACC6, Lennox XC13, Rheem RA14 | $3,500–$6,000 |
| 2.5 ton | 30,000 | Carrier 24SPA6, Trane XR15, Goodman GSXC7 | $4,000–$7,000 |
| 3 ton | 36,000 | Carrier Infinity 24ANB6, Lennox XC21, Trane XV18 | $4,500–$8,000 |
| 3.5 ton | 42,000 | Carrier 24SPA6, Trane XR15, Rheem RA16 | $5,000–$9,000 |
| 4 ton | 48,000 | Carrier Infinity, Lennox SL28XCV, Trane XV20i | $5,500–$10,000 |
| 5 ton | 60,000 | Carrier Infinity, Lennox SL28XCV, Trane XV20i | $6,500–$12,000 |

*Costs include outdoor condenser, indoor coil, refrigerant lines, labor, and permit. Excludes furnace/air handler replacement.*

## Tonnage and SEER2: How Efficiency Affects Your Decision

Higher-efficiency AC units cost more upfront but less to operate. Here's the annual operating cost comparison by tonnage and efficiency:

| Tonnage | SEER2 14 Annual Cost | SEER2 18 Annual Cost | SEER2 22 Annual Cost | SEER2 26 Annual Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 ton | $350 | $270 | $220 | $190 |
| 3 ton | $520 | $410 | $340 | $280 |
| 4 ton | $700 | $540 | $450 | $380 |
| 5 ton | $870 | $680 | $560 | $470 |

*Based on 1,200 cooling hours/year at $0.15/kWh national average. Hot climates (2,000+ cooling hours) pay significantly more.*

A 3-ton SEER2 22 system saves $180/year over SEER2 14. Over the system's 15–20 year lifespan, that's $2,700–$3,600 in savings — usually more than the efficiency upgrade cost.

## When Your Home Needs Two Systems

Split systems become necessary when:

- **Total load exceeds 5 tons (60,000 BTU)** — the maximum for a single residential unit
- **Two-story homes with poor duct access** — separate systems per floor deliver much better comfort
- **Long duct runs (over 50 feet)** — efficiency drops significantly, making two shorter systems better
- **Different occupancy patterns** — if the upstairs bedrooms are empty during the day, a two-system approach lets you cool only what you use

When designing a two-system home, the typical split is:

| Floor | Tonnage Share | Why |
|---|---|---|
| First floor | 45–50% of total | Ground level, less roof exposure |
| Second floor | 50–55% of total | Heat rises, roof exposure, duct losses |

A 4,000 sq ft two-story home needing 7.5 total tons might use a 3.5-ton system for the first floor and a 4-ton system for the second floor.

**Key Takeaways**

1. One ton = 12,000 BTU. Most homes need 1 ton per 400–600 sq ft depending on climate
2. Standard residential AC sizes: 1.5 / 2 / 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4 / 5 tons. Maximum single unit is 5 tons
3. Climate zone is the biggest tonnage driver: a 2,000 sq ft home needs 2.5 tons in cool climates but 4 tons in hot climates
4. Oversizing by one full ton (e.g., 4 ton where 3 ton is needed) wastes $100–$200/year in efficiency losses and creates humidity problems
5. New homes (2020s code) need 20–40% less tonnage than older homes of the same square footage
6. Homes over 3,000 sq ft in hot climates almost always need two systems

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ>
  <FAQ.Item question="How many tons of AC per square foot?">
    The general rule is 1 ton per 400–600 square feet, depending on climate. In hot climates like Phoenix or Houston, budget 1 ton per 400–450 sq ft. In moderate climates like Atlanta or Nashville, 1 ton per 500–550 sq ft. In cool climates like Chicago or Boston, 1 ton per 600–700 sq ft. These assume average insulation and 8-foot ceilings.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size AC do I need for 2,000 sq ft?">
    For 2,000 sq ft with average insulation: 3.5–4 tons in hot climates, 3–3.5 tons in moderate climates, or 2.5–3 tons in cool climates. Run the full BTU calculation with adjustment factors for accuracy — the range can vary from 2.5 to 5 tons for the same square footage depending on insulation, ceiling height, windows, and ductwork condition.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is a 3-ton AC enough for 1,500 sq ft?">
    In most cases, yes. A 3-ton AC delivers 36,000 BTU, which covers 1,500 sq ft at 24 BTU/sq ft — adequate for average conditions in Zones 2–4. In hot climates with poor insulation, you might need 3.5 tons. In cool climates with good insulation, 2 or 2.5 tons may suffice. A 3-ton unit is the most common size for 1,500 sq ft homes nationwide.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What happens if my AC is half a ton too big?">
    Half a ton (6,000 BTU) of oversizing is within acceptable range for most homes. With a single-stage compressor, you'll see slightly shorter run cycles, marginally higher humidity, and 5–8% higher energy costs. With a two-stage or variable-speed compressor, half a ton of oversizing has minimal impact because the unit modulates down. It's not ideal but not catastrophic.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How do I know what tonnage my current AC is?">
    Look at the model number on the outdoor condenser. Most manufacturers embed the tonnage in the model number as "18" (1.5 ton), "24" (2 ton), "30" (2.5 ton), "36" (3 ton), "42" (3.5 ton), "48" (4 ton), or "60" (5 ton). These numbers represent thousands of BTU. Alternatively, check the data plate for "cooling capacity" in BTU and divide by 12,000.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can a 2.5-ton AC cool a 2,000 sq ft house?">
    It depends on your climate and home construction. In Zone 5–6 (Chicago, Minneapolis) with good insulation, a 2.5-ton AC can handle 2,000 sq ft adequately. In Zone 3–4 (Atlanta, Nashville) with average insulation, 2.5 tons is likely undersized — you'd need 3–3.5 tons. In Zone 2 (Houston, Phoenix), 2.5 tons is definitely undersized for 2,000 sq ft. Always calculate based on your specific conditions.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What's the difference between AC tonnage and BTU?">
    Tonnage and BTU both measure cooling capacity, just at different scales. One ton equals exactly 12,000 BTU per hour. The "ton" unit originates from the cooling effect of melting one ton (2,000 pounds) of ice over 24 hours. Central AC systems are sold in tons; window units and mini splits are sold in BTU. To convert: tons × 12,000 = BTU, or BTU ÷ 12,000 = tons.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Does a higher SEER2 rating mean I need a smaller AC?">
    No. SEER2 measures efficiency (how much cooling per watt of electricity), not capacity (how much total cooling). A 3-ton SEER2 14 unit and a 3-ton SEER2 22 unit both deliver 36,000 BTU of cooling. The SEER2 22 unit just uses less electricity to do it. Size your system by BTU/tonnage first, then choose the SEER2 level based on your budget and desired operating cost.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What tonnage AC do I need for a 3,000 sq ft home?">
    A 3,000 sq ft home typically needs 4–5 tons in moderate climates and 5+ tons (likely two systems) in hot climates. In Zone 3–4, a single 5-ton system usually handles 3,000 sq ft with average insulation. In Zone 2 with older construction, the total load may exceed 5 tons, requiring a 3-ton + 2.5-ton two-system setup. In Zone 5–6, a single 3.5–4 ton system may suffice.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does an extra ton of AC capacity cost?">
    Each additional ton of AC capacity adds approximately $500–$1,500 to the equipment cost and $200–$500 to installation cost. A 4-ton system typically costs $1,000–$2,000 more than a 3-ton system of the same brand and efficiency level. However, the real cost of wrong sizing isn't in the equipment — it's in the 10–20% higher annual operating costs and reduced equipment lifespan from short cycling.
