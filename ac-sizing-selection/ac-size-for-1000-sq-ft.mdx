# What Size AC for 1,000 Sq Ft?

**A 1,000 square foot home or apartment needs 1.5–2 tons (18,000–24,000 BTU) of air conditioning in most climates, with poorly insulated homes in hot regions requiring up to 2.5 tons (30,000 BTU).** The baseline calculation is simple — 1,000 × 20 BTU/sq ft = 20,000 BTU — but your climate zone, insulation, ceiling height, and window exposure can shift that number by 30–50% in either direction.

At 1,000 sq ft, you're in the sweet spot where a single AC system handles the entire space efficiently. This guide gives you the exact tonnage for your specific conditions plus equipment recommendations and cost data.

<TableOfContents />

## AC Size for 1,000 Sq Ft by Climate Zone

| Climate Zone | Cities | Recommended BTU | Recommended Tonnage | Annual Cooling Cost (est.) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zone 1 (Hot-Humid) | Miami, Key West | 25,000–30,000 | 2–2.5 ton | $550–$750 |
| Zone 2 (Hot) | Houston, Phoenix, Tampa | 22,000–28,000 | 2–2.5 ton | $450–$650 |
| Zone 3 (Warm) | Atlanta, Dallas, Charlotte | 20,000–25,000 | 1.5–2 ton | $350–$500 |
| Zone 4 (Mixed) | Nashville, St. Louis, DC | 18,000–22,000 | 1.5–2 ton | $250–$400 |
| Zone 5 (Cool) | Chicago, Denver, Boston | 16,000–20,000 | 1.5 ton | $200–$350 |
| Zone 6 (Cold) | Minneapolis, Milwaukee | 14,000–18,000 | 1.5 ton | $150–$250 |

## Adjustment Factors for 1,000 Sq Ft Homes

Your specific home characteristics shift the baseline:

| Factor | Adjustment | Adjusted BTU for 1,000 Sq Ft |
|---|---|---|
| **Baseline (Zone 4, average)** | — | 20,000 BTU |
| Poor insulation (pre-1980) | +30% | 26,000 BTU |
| Good insulation (2015+ code) | −15% | 17,000 BTU |
| 9-foot ceilings | +12% | 22,400 BTU |
| 10-foot ceilings | +25% | 25,000 BTU |
| Top floor / upper level | +15% | 23,000 BTU |
| Basement level | −20% | 16,000 BTU |
| Large windows, sun-exposed | +15% | 23,000 BTU |
| Open kitchen included | +4,000 BTU | 24,000 BTU |
| Heavy shade, trees | −10% | 18,000 BTU |
| Leaky ductwork in attic | +20% | 24,000 BTU |

## Sizing Examples for 1,000 Sq Ft

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: 1,000 sq ft condo in Phoenix, AZ**

Top floor, 9-ft ceilings, west-facing sliding glass doors, average insulation (2005 build), open kitchen.

- Base: 1,000 × 26 (Zone 2) = 26,000
- 9-ft ceilings: +12% = 29,120
- Top floor: +15% = 33,488
- West-facing glass: +15% = 38,511
- Kitchen: +4,000 = 42,511
- Dry climate: −10% = 38,260

**Result: 38,260 BTU → 3.5-ton system.** In a Phoenix top-floor unit with west-facing glass, even 1,000 sq ft demands serious cooling capacity. Window tinting or exterior blinds could reduce this by 5,000–8,000 BTU.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: 1,000 sq ft ranch in Indianapolis, IN**

Single story, 8-ft ceilings, moderate windows, average insulation (1998), shaded by mature trees.

- Base: 1,000 × 20 (Zone 5) = 20,000
- Shade trees: −10% = 18,000
- Average ductwork: +0% = 18,000

**Result: 18,000 BTU → 1.5-ton system.** A well-shaded 1,000 sq ft home in a moderate climate is the easiest sizing scenario. A 1.5-ton system provides comfortable cooling with energy to spare.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: 1,000 sq ft new-build apartment in Austin, TX**

Ground floor, 9-ft ceilings, above-code insulation (2024 build), ducts inside conditioned space, minimal windows.

- Base: 1,000 × 22 (Zone 2) = 22,000
- Excellent insulation: −20% = 17,600
- 9-ft ceilings: +12% = 19,712
- Ducts in conditioned space: −10% = 17,741
- Ground floor: −5% = 16,854

**Result: 16,854 BTU → 1.5-ton system.** Modern construction dramatically reduces cooling loads. This new Austin apartment needs the same tonnage as the shaded ranch in Indianapolis despite being in a much hotter climate.

## System Options for 1,000 Sq Ft

| System Type | BTU Range | Installed Cost (2026) | SEER2 Range | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Central AC (1.5 ton) | 18,000 | $3,500–$6,000 | 14–22 | Ducted homes |
| Central AC (2 ton) | 24,000 | $4,000–$6,500 | 14–22 | Hot climates, ducted |
| Mini split (single-zone) | 18,000–24,000 | $2,500–$4,500 | 18–33 | Open-plan, no ducts |
| Mini split (2-zone) | 18,000–24,000 | $4,000–$7,000 | 16–24 | Separated rooms |
| Window AC (2 units) | 10,000–12,000 each | $500–$1,000 total | 10–12 CEER | Budget, rental |
| Heat pump (1.5–2 ton) | 18,000–24,000 | $5,000–$8,000 | 16–22 | Heat + cool, efficiency |

For 1,000 sq ft, a single mini split or small central system is the most cost-effective approach. Avoid splitting into too many zones — a single 18,000 BTU unit serves an open 1,000 sq ft apartment better than three 6,000 BTU heads.

## Monthly Cooling Cost for 1,000 Sq Ft

| System Efficiency | Monthly Cost (hot climate) | Monthly Cost (moderate climate) | Monthly Cost (cool climate) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEER2 14 | $95–$130 | $55–$75 | $30–$50 |
| SEER2 18 | $75–$100 | $45–$60 | $25–$40 |
| SEER2 22 | $60–$85 | $35–$50 | $20–$30 |
| SEER2 26+ | $50–$70 | $30–$40 | $15–$25 |

*Based on $0.15/kWh. Multiply by your local rate ÷ 0.15 for your costs.*

**Key Takeaways**

1. Most 1,000 sq ft homes need 1.5–2 tons (18,000–24,000 BTU) — a 3-ton or larger system is almost certainly oversized
2. Climate zone and insulation quality are the two biggest variables at this size
3. New construction (2020s code) may need only 1.5 tons even in warm climates due to improved insulation
4. A single mini split or small central system is the most cost-effective approach — avoid over-zoning
5. Monthly cooling costs typically run $30–$100 depending on climate and efficiency
6. At 1,000 sq ft, the difference between SEER2 14 and 22 saves $20–$45/month — significant over 15 years

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ>
  <FAQ.Item question="Is 1.5 tons enough for 1,000 sq ft?">
    In most cases, yes. A 1.5-ton system delivers 18,000 BTU, which covers 1,000 sq ft at 18 BTU/sq ft — sufficient for Zones 4–6 with average to good insulation. In hot climates (Zones 1–2) or homes with poor insulation, large windows, or upper floors, you may need 2–2.5 tons instead.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does AC cost for a 1,000 sq ft house?">
    A new central AC for 1,000 sq ft costs $3,500–$6,500 installed (1.5–2 ton system). A mini split runs $2,500–$4,500. A heat pump (heating and cooling) costs $5,000–$8,000. Annual operating cost for cooling is $250–$650 depending on climate and efficiency. Over a 15-year system life, a higher-efficiency unit typically saves $1,500–$4,000 in operating costs.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can I use a window AC for 1,000 sq ft?">
    One window AC cannot effectively cool 1,000 sq ft — the maximum practical range for a window unit is about 550 sq ft (for a 12,000 BTU model). For 1,000 sq ft, you'd need 2–3 window units placed strategically. This costs $500–$1,200 total but is less efficient and more intrusive than a single mini split or central system.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size mini split for 1,000 sq ft?">
    For an open-plan 1,000 sq ft space, an 18,000 BTU (1.5-ton) single-zone mini split is ideal in moderate climates. In hot climates, size up to 24,000 BTU (2 ton). If the 1,000 sq ft is divided into separate rooms, consider a 2-zone multi-split with 12,000 + 9,000 BTU heads or two separate single-zone units.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How many BTU for a 1,000 sq ft apartment?">
    A 1,000 sq ft apartment needs 18,000–24,000 BTU for cooling in most climates. Apartments often need slightly less than houses because they benefit from shared walls with conditioned neighbors (reducing heat gain). A ground-floor interior apartment might need only 16,000 BTU, while a top-floor corner unit with south/west exposure might need 26,000 BTU.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="1.5 ton vs 2 ton AC for 1,000 sq ft — which is better?">
    In Zones 4–6 with average or better insulation, 1.5 tons is the right size and provides better humidity control and efficiency. In Zones 2–3 or homes with poor insulation, high ceilings, or sun-exposed windows, 2 tons is the better choice. If you're borderline, a 2-ton variable-speed or two-stage system gives you flexibility to modulate between the two capacities.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What SEER rating should I get for 1,000 sq ft?">
    The minimum SEER2 is 13.4 (North) or 14.3 (South). For 1,000 sq ft, upgrading to SEER2 18–20 adds $500–$1,500 upfront but saves $15–$40/month in hot climates. In cool climates with short cooling seasons, the payback period for high-SEER2 is longer, so SEER2 15–16 may be the sweet spot. In hot climates (2,000+ cooling hours), invest in SEER2 18+ — the savings are substantial.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can a 1-ton AC cool 1,000 sq ft?">
    A 1-ton AC (12,000 BTU) is generally too small for 1,000 sq ft. It might work in a very well-insulated home in a cool climate (Zone 6–7) where you only need 12–14 BTU/sq ft. For most homes, 1 ton only covers 400–600 sq ft comfortably. Running a 1-ton unit in a 1,000 sq ft space causes constant operation, poor humidity control, and premature equipment failure.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size AC for 1,000 sq ft with high ceilings?">
    For 9-foot ceilings, add 12% — pushing a 1,000 sq ft home from 20,000 to 22,400 BTU (still 2 tons). For 10-foot ceilings, add 25% — pushing to 25,000 BTU (2–2.5 tons). For 12-foot ceilings, add 50% — pushing to 30,000 BTU (2.5 tons). Vaulted ceilings with average heights of 14 feet push the need to 35,000 BTU (3 tons) for the same 1,000 sq ft footprint.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do I need central AC or a mini split for 1,000 sq ft?">
    If your home already has ductwork, central AC is usually the simplest choice ($3,500–$6,500). If there's no ductwork, a mini split is more affordable ($2,500–$4,500) and more efficient than adding ductwork ($5,000–$10,000+). Mini splits also offer zone control and can provide heating in winter. For 1,000 sq ft without existing ducts, a mini split is almost always the better investment.
