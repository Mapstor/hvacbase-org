# What Size AC for 2,000 Sq Ft?

**A 2,000 square foot home typically needs a 3-ton (36,000 BTU) air conditioner, with the range spanning from 2.5 tons in cool, well-insulated homes to 4 tons in hot climates with older construction.** At 2,000 sq ft, you're in the most common home size range in America, and the difference between correct and incorrect sizing is 10–20% on your annual energy bill — $100–$300 per year.

This is the size where two-story homes start to benefit from zoning, and where the investment in higher-efficiency equipment (SEER2 18+) generates meaningful annual savings. Let's find your exact tonnage.

<TableOfContents />

## AC Size for 2,000 Sq Ft by Climate Zone

| Climate Zone | Cities | BTU Range | Tonnage | Est. Annual Cool Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zone 1 (Hot-Humid) | Miami, Key West | 50,000–60,000 | 4–5 ton | $800–$1,100 |
| Zone 2 (Hot) | Houston, Phoenix, Tampa | 44,000–56,000 | 3.5–4.5 ton | $650–$950 |
| Zone 3 (Warm) | Atlanta, Dallas, Charlotte | 40,000–50,000 | 3–4 ton | $500–$750 |
| Zone 4 (Mixed) | Nashville, DC, St. Louis | 36,000–44,000 | 3–3.5 ton | $400–$600 |
| Zone 5 (Cool) | Chicago, Denver, Boston | 32,000–40,000 | 2.5–3 ton | $300–$450 |
| Zone 6 (Cold) | Minneapolis, Milwaukee | 28,000–36,000 | 2.5–3 ton | $200–$350 |

## Single-Story vs. Two-Story: Sizing Differences

At 2,000 sq ft, your home layout significantly impacts sizing:

| Layout | Sizing Consideration | Typical Tonnage (Zone 4) |
|---|---|---|
| Single-story ranch (2,000 sq ft one floor) | Large roof exposure, simple ductwork | 3–3.5 ton |
| Two-story (1,000 per floor) | Less roof exposure, but upper floor runs hotter | 3 ton (1 system with zoning) or 1.5 + 2 ton (2 systems) |
| Split-level | Complex duct routing, natural temperature zones | 3 ton with zoning dampers |
| L-shaped or U-shaped | Long duct runs to distant rooms | 3–3.5 ton (consider duct layout) |

<Callout type="tip">
**Two-story 2,000 sq ft homes benefit most from zoning.** A single 3-ton system with a zoning damper system ($500–$1,500 addon) directs more airflow upstairs during the day and balances at night. Without zoning, the downstairs stays at 72°F while the upstairs struggles at 78°F.
</Callout>

## Sizing Examples

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: 2,000 sq ft two-story colonial in Richmond, VA (Zone 4)**

1,000 sq ft per floor. Average insulation (2001 build). 9-ft first floor, 8-ft second floor. Standard windows. Ducts in attic for second floor, in basement for first.

- Base: 2,000 × 20 = 40,000 BTU
- Mixed ceiling heights: +6% average = 42,400
- First-floor ducts (conditioned space): −5% for half = 41,280
- Second-floor attic ducts: +10% for half = 43,344

**Result: 43,344 BTU → 3.5-ton system.** A 3.5-ton two-stage or variable-speed unit is ideal — it runs on low stage (2.1–2.5 tons) during mild weather and ramps to 3.5 tons on the hottest days. Add zoning for optimal floor-by-floor comfort.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: 2,000 sq ft new-build ranch in San Antonio, TX (Zone 2)**

Single-story, 9-ft ceilings, excellent insulation (2025 code), Low-E windows, sealed ducts in conditioned attic, open-plan kitchen/living.

- Base: 2,000 × 22 = 44,000 BTU
- Excellent insulation: −20% = 35,200
- 9-ft ceilings: +12% = 39,424
- Conditioned-space ducts: −10% = 35,482
- Kitchen: +4,000 = 39,482
- Humidity: +10% = 43,430

**Result: 43,430 BTU → 3.5-ton system.** Even with excellent insulation, San Antonio's heat and humidity push a new 2,000 sq ft home to 3.5 tons. The good news: a SEER2 20 system at 3.5 tons costs only $45–$60/month to operate versus $70–$95 at SEER2 14.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: 2,000 sq ft Cape Cod in Boston, MA (Zone 5)**

1.5-story (1,200 sq ft main + 800 sq ft finished attic). Insulation upgraded (R-21 walls, R-49 attic). 8-ft ceilings main, 7-ft kneewalls in attic.

- Base: 2,000 × 18 = 36,000 BTU
- Good insulation: −10% = 32,400
- Attic rooms (heat gain): +15% for 800 sq ft portion = 36,180
- Average ductwork: +0% = 36,180

**Result: 36,180 BTU → 3-ton system.** The finished attic rooms add load that almost exactly offsets the insulation savings. A 3-ton system is the sweet spot. Consider a mini split head in the attic space for supplemental cooling if it runs hot.

## Equipment Options and Costs (2026)

| System Type | Tonnage | Installed Cost | SEER2 | Annual Cool Cost (Zone 3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single-stage central AC | 3 ton | $4,000–$6,000 | 14–15 | $550–$650 |
| Two-stage central AC | 3 ton | $5,500–$8,000 | 17–19 | $400–$500 |
| Variable-speed central AC | 3 ton | $7,000–$11,000 | 20–24 | $300–$400 |
| Standard heat pump | 3 ton | $5,500–$8,500 | 16–19 | $350–$500 (heat+cool) |
| Cold-climate heat pump | 3.5 ton | $7,500–$12,000 | 17–22 | $400–$550 (heat+cool) |
| Ductless mini splits (4-zone) | 36K total | $8,000–$14,000 | 18–28 | $280–$400 |

## When 2,000 Sq Ft Needs Two Systems

A single system works for most 2,000 sq ft homes, but these scenarios warrant two units:

- **Two-story home with no basement (attic-only ductwork):** Two 1.5-ton systems (one per floor) often outperform one 3-ton system with long duct runs
- **Home with an addition:** Original 1,500 sq ft + 500 sq ft addition — the addition often can't connect to existing ductwork efficiently
- **Extreme climate (Zone 1–2) with poor insulation:** Total load exceeds 5 tons
- **Ranch with a finished detached room:** Mother-in-law suite, workshop, or ADU needs independent system

<Callout type="takeaway">
**Key Takeaways**

1. Most 2,000 sq ft homes need 3 tons (36,000 BTU) — the most common residential AC tonnage
2. Range: 2.5 tons (cool climate, great insulation) to 4+ tons (hot climate, poor insulation)
3. Two-story homes benefit significantly from zoning ($500–$1,500 addon) for floor-by-floor comfort
4. New construction (2020s code) needs 0.5–1 ton less than older homes of the same size
5. The jump from SEER2 14 to SEER2 20 saves $150–$250/year at this home size — payback in 5–8 years
6. At 2,000 sq ft, a single well-designed system beats two smaller systems in almost every scenario

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ>
  <FAQ.Item question="Is 3 tons enough for 2,000 sq ft?">
    In Zones 4–6 with average to good insulation, 3 tons (36,000 BTU) is the right size for 2,000 sq ft. In Zones 2–3 with poor insulation or high solar gain, you may need 3.5–4 tons. A properly conducted Manual J calculation confirms the exact number — don't let a contractor simply default to "1 ton per 500 sq ft."
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does AC cost for a 2,000 sq ft house?">
    Equipment + installation: $4,000–$12,000 depending on system type and efficiency. A budget 3-ton central AC runs $4,000–$6,000. A premium variable-speed system runs $7,000–$11,000. Annual cooling costs: $300–$700 in moderate climates, $600–$1,100 in hot climates. Over 15 years, total ownership cost (purchase + energy) ranges from $12,000 to $25,000.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="3 ton or 3.5 ton for 2,000 sq ft?">
    If your calculation falls between 36,000 and 42,000 BTU, choose based on your compressor type. For single-stage: pick the closer size (0.5 ton of oversizing causes short cycling). For two-stage or variable-speed: the 3.5-ton unit is fine because it modulates to 2.1 tons on low stage. When in doubt, a 3-ton variable-speed outperforms a 3.5-ton single-stage for comfort and efficiency.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do I need two AC units for 2,000 sq ft?">
    Rarely. A single 3–3.5 ton system with proper ductwork handles 2,000 sq ft well. Two units only make sense for two-story homes with no duct connection between floors, homes with additions that can't tie into existing ducts, or extreme climate situations where total load exceeds 5 tons.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size heat pump for a 2,000 sq ft house?">
    For cooling: 3 tons in moderate climates, 3.5 tons in hot climates. For heating: check the unit's capacity at your winter design temperature — in Zones 5–6, you may need 3.5–4.5 tons to handle the heating load without excessive backup strip heat. A 3.5-ton cold-climate heat pump is the most versatile choice for 2,000 sq ft in Zones 3–5.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size ductwork for a 2,000 sq ft house with a 3-ton AC?">
    A 3-ton system moves approximately 1,200 CFM. The main trunk duct should be 20"×8" or equivalent. Branch runs to individual rooms are typically 6"–8" diameter flex or rigid duct. Undersized ductwork is one of the most common installation mistakes — it restricts airflow, reduces capacity, and causes noise. ACCA Manual D provides the proper sizing methodology.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How many square feet does a 3-ton AC cool?">
    A 3-ton AC (36,000 BTU) typically cools 1,600–2,200 sq ft depending on climate and conditions. In Zone 2 (hot), it covers about 1,400–1,800 sq ft. In Zone 4 (moderate), about 1,800–2,200 sq ft. In Zone 5–6 (cool), about 2,000–2,500 sq ft. These ranges assume average insulation and 8-foot ceilings.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What SEER2 should I get for 2,000 sq ft?">
    At 2,000 sq ft, efficiency upgrades generate meaningful savings. In hot climates (Zones 1–3, 1,500+ cooling hours), invest in SEER2 18–22 — the $2,000–$4,000 premium pays back in 5–8 years. In moderate climates (Zone 4), SEER2 16–18 offers the best value. In cool climates (Zones 5–6, under 800 cooling hours), SEER2 14–16 is usually sufficient.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can I use a mini split system for 2,000 sq ft?">
    Yes. A 4-zone multi-split system (36,000 BTU outdoor unit + 4 indoor heads) handles 2,000 sq ft with excellent zone control. Cost: $8,000–$14,000 installed. Alternatively, 2–3 separate single-zone mini splits can cover the space more efficiently (each unit operates independently). Mini splits make the most sense when there's no existing ductwork or when zone control is a priority.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size furnace goes with a 3-ton AC for 2,000 sq ft?">
    The furnace must match the AC's airflow requirement (1,200 CFM for 3 tons). Common pairings for 2,000 sq ft: Zone 3–4 needs 60,000–80,000 BTU furnace; Zone 5 needs 80,000–100,000 BTU; Zone 6 needs 100,000–120,000 BTU. Always check AHRI matching to ensure the furnace blower and AC coil are certified to work together.
