# Water Heater Sizing Calculator: Tank vs Tankless Sizing

**For a tank water heater, size by first-hour rating (FHR): a family of 4 typically needs an FHR of 60–80 gallons, which corresponds to a 50-gallon gas tank or a 65–80-gallon electric tank.** For a tankless water heater, size by flow rate: the same family needs 4.0–5.5 GPM, translating to a 150,000–199,000 BTU gas tankless or a 27–36 kW electric tankless (warm climates only).

Choosing between tank and tankless — and picking the right size — comes down to your peak demand patterns, available fuel type, upfront budget, and long-term operating cost preferences. This guide sizes both types for your specific household.

<TableOfContents />

## Tank Water Heater Sizing: First-Hour Rating Method

The DOE recommends sizing tank water heaters by **first-hour rating (FHR)**, not tank capacity. FHR tells you how many gallons of hot water the unit can deliver in the first hour of heavy use, starting with a full tank. It combines tank capacity + recovery rate.

### Step 1: Calculate Your Peak-Hour Demand

Add up hot water usage during your busiest hour (typically the morning routine):

| Activity | Average Hot Water (gallons) |
|---|---|
| Shower (10 min) | 20 |
| Low-flow shower (10 min) | 12 |
| Bath | 20–30 |
| Shaving (5 min) | 2 |
| Hand/face washing | 2 |
| Dishwasher (per load) | 6–10 |
| Hand-washing dishes | 4 |
| Clothes washer (hot cycle) | 7–12 |
| Food preparation | 3–5 |

### Step 2: Match FHR to Your Peak-Hour Demand

| Peak-Hour Demand (gallons) | Minimum FHR Needed |
|---|---|
| 30–40 | 40 |
| 40–55 | 55 |
| 55–70 | 67 |
| 70–85 | 80 |
| 85–100 | 95 |

### Household Size Quick Reference

| Household | Bathrooms | Peak-Hour Demand (gallons) | Gas Tank Size | Electric Tank Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 person | 1 | 25–35 | 30–40 gallon | 40–50 gallon |
| 2 people | 1–2 | 35–50 | 40–50 gallon | 50–65 gallon |
| 3 people | 1–2 | 45–60 | 40–50 gallon | 50–65 gallon |
| 4 people | 2–3 | 55–75 | 50–65 gallon | 65–80 gallon |
| 5 people | 2–3 | 65–85 | 50–75 gallon | 80 gallon |
| 6+ people | 3+ | 80–100+ | 75 gallon (or 2 units) | 80 gallon (or 2 units) |

<Callout type="info">
**Why electric tanks are larger than gas:** Electric water heaters have slower recovery rates — a 50-gallon electric heater recovers about 21 gallons per hour, while a 50-gallon gas heater recovers 40–50 gallons per hour. To match the same FHR, electric tanks need to be 20–30% larger to compensate with stored hot water volume.

## Tankless Water Heater Sizing: Flow Rate Method

Tankless units are sized by **GPM (gallons per minute) at a specific temperature rise**. See our comprehensive tankless water heater sizing guide for the full calculation method. Here's the summary:

| Household | Bathrooms | Peak GPM Needed | Gas BTU (Cold Climate) | Gas BTU (Warm Climate) | Electric kW (Warm Only) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 person | 1 | 1.5–2.0 | 100,000 | 75,000 | 14–18 kW |
| 2 people | 1–2 | 2.5–3.5 | 140,000–160,000 | 100,000–120,000 | 22–27 kW |
| 3–4 people | 2–3 | 4.0–5.5 | 180,000–199,000 | 140,000–160,000 | 27–36 kW |
| 5–6 people | 3–4 | 5.5–7.5 | 199,000+ (or 2 units) | 180,000–199,000 | Not feasible |

## Tank vs. Tankless: Complete Comparison

| Factor | Tank Water Heater | Tankless Water Heater |
|---|---|---|
| **Upfront cost (installed)** | $800–$2,000 | $1,500–$4,500 |
| **Annual operating cost (gas)** | $250–$400 | $175–$300 |
| **Annual operating cost (electric)** | $400–$600 | $300–$500 |
| **Hot water supply** | Limited by tank size | Unlimited (if sized correctly) |
| **Recovery rate** | 30–50 GPH (gas), 20 GPH (electric) | Continuous at rated GPM |
| **Lifespan** | 8–12 years | 15–20 years (gas), 8–15 years (electric) |
| **Space required** | 24" × 24" × 60" (typical 50-gal) | 14" × 10" × 26" (wall-mounted) |
| **Maintenance** | Annual anode rod check, periodic flush | Annual descaling (hard water) |
| **Energy factor (UEF)** | 0.58–0.70 (gas), 0.92–0.95 (electric) | 0.87–0.96 (gas), 0.96–0.99 (electric) |
| **Venting** | Existing flue (gas) | Direct vent or power vent (gas) |
| **Wait time for hot water** | Depends on pipe distance | 2–5 sec cold water sandwich |
| **Best for** | Budget installs, large simultaneous demand | Endless hot water, space savings, long-term economy |

### Heat Pump Water Heaters: The Efficiency Leader

Heat pump water heaters (HPWH) deserve special mention. They use a heat pump to extract heat from surrounding air, achieving UEF ratings of 2.0–4.0 — meaning they produce 2–4× more hot water energy than the electricity they consume. They cost $1,500–$3,000 installed and save $200–$400/year compared to conventional electric tanks.

| HPWH Factor | Specification |
|---|---|
| Tank sizes available | 40, 50, 65, 80 gallon |
| UEF range | 2.0–4.0 |
| Annual operating cost | $100–$250 |
| Space needed | 750+ cubic feet of ambient air (can't be in a tight closet) |
| Noise level | 45–55 dB (like a running dishwasher) |
| Best for | Homes with electric water heating, garages, basements, utility rooms |
| IRA tax credit (2026) | Up to $2,000 |
| Temperature range | Works best in 40–120°F ambient air |

**Example 1: Family of 4 in Phoenix (warm climate, gas available)**

Morning routine: 2 showers (20 gallons each), dishwasher (8 gallons), hand washing (4 gallons) = 52 gallons peak hour.

**Tank option:** 50-gallon gas tank with FHR of 67 gallons. Cost: $1,000–$1,500 installed. Annual operating cost: $300.

**Tankless option:** 2 simultaneous showers (4.0 GPM) + dishwasher (1.0 GPM) = 5.0 GPM. Temperature rise: 55°F. Need: 140,000+ BTU gas tankless. Cost: $2,500–$3,500 installed. Annual operating cost: $200.

**Payback period for tankless:** ($3,000 − $1,250) / ($300 − $200) = 17.5 years. The tankless unit is more expensive but lasts longer (18 years vs 10 years), provides unlimited hot water, and takes less space.

**Example 2: Couple in Seattle (cool climate, electric only)**

Morning routine: 1 shower (12 gallons, low-flow), coffee + breakfast prep (3 gallons) = 15 gallons peak hour.

**Tank option:** 40-gallon electric tank with FHR of 40 gallons. Cost: $800–$1,200 installed. Annual operating cost: $350.

**HPWH option:** 50-gallon heat pump water heater. Cost: $2,000–$2,800 installed. Annual operating cost: $120. IRA credit: $2,000. Effective cost: $0–$800.

**HPWH wins decisively** — after the tax credit, it costs similar to (or less than) a standard electric tank and saves $230/year in operating costs.

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: Family of 6 in Chicago (cold climate, gas available)**

Morning rush: 3 showers (60 gallons), breakfast dishes (6 gallons), morning laundry (10 gallons) = 76 gallons peak hour.

**Tank option:** 75-gallon gas tank with FHR of 90 gallons. Cost: $1,500–$2,200 installed. Annual operating cost: $400.

**Tankless option:** Peak demand = 3 simultaneous showers (6.0 GPM). Temperature rise: 76°F. Need: 250,000+ BTU — exceeds single-unit capacity. Requires two gas tankless units in parallel. Cost: $4,500–$6,000 installed. Annual operating cost: $275.

**The 75-gallon tank is the smarter choice here.** Two tankless units cost $3,000–$4,000 more upfront, and the $125/year savings gives a 24–32 year payback — longer than the equipment lifespan. The tank also handles the extreme simultaneous demand more reliably.

**Key Takeaways**

1. Size tank heaters by first-hour rating (FHR), not just tank capacity — a 50-gallon gas tank delivers 67+ gallons in the first hour
2. Size tankless heaters by peak GPM and temperature rise — always use winter groundwater temps
3. Gas tanks recover 2× faster than electric; electric tanks need to be 20–30% larger to compensate
4. Heat pump water heaters are the most efficient electric option (UEF 2.0–4.0), with up to $2,000 in IRA tax credits in 2026
5. Tankless is best for 1–4 person households in warm climates; large families in cold climates often get better value from large tank heaters
6. The most important metric is matching your peak-hour demand — running out of hot water during morning routines is the #1 complaint

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ>
  <FAQ.Item question="What size tank water heater do I need for a family of 4?">
    A family of 4 typically needs a 50-gallon gas tank (FHR 67+ gallons) or a 65–80 gallon electric tank (FHR 55–70 gallons). The exact size depends on your morning routine — two simultaneous showers + dishwasher demands about 55–75 gallons of hot water in the peak hour. For families that stagger showers, a 40-gallon gas tank may suffice.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Is a 40-gallon water heater enough for 2 people?">
    Yes, a 40-gallon gas water heater (FHR ~55 gallons) is typically adequate for 2 people. It handles a morning shower, shaving, and light kitchen use simultaneously. For 2 people who take long showers or enjoy baths, a 50-gallon tank provides more comfortable capacity. A 40-gallon electric tank may be tight for 2 people due to slower recovery.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Should I get a tank or tankless water heater?">
    Choose tankless if you want unlimited hot water, have 1–4 people, gas is available, and you plan to stay in your home 10+ years (to recoup the higher upfront cost). Choose a tank if you have a large family (5+), limited budget, or cold-climate electric-only service. Choose a heat pump water heater if you're on electric and want the lowest operating costs with tax credit savings.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What is first-hour rating and why does it matter?">
    First-hour rating (FHR) is the number of gallons of hot water a tank heater delivers in its first hour of use, starting full. It combines stored hot water + recovery rate. FHR matters more than tank size because a small tank with fast recovery (high BTU) can deliver more hot water per hour than a large tank with slow recovery. Always compare FHR when shopping, not just tank gallons.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How long does a tank water heater last?">
    Gas tank water heaters last 8–12 years, and electric tank heaters last 10–15 years. The main failure point is the tank itself (corrosion from the inside). Replacing the anode rod every 3–5 years and flushing sediment annually can extend lifespan to the upper range. Hard water shortens lifespan by 2–4 years. Tankless units last 15–20 years, and heat pump water heaters last 10–15 years.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can a tankless water heater fill a bathtub?">
    Yes, but it takes longer than filling from a tank. A standard bathtub holds 40–60 gallons. A tankless unit delivering 4.0 GPM fills a tub in 10–15 minutes with fully heated water. The advantage: you never run out of hot water mid-fill. The disadvantage: if someone starts a shower while the tub is filling, the water temperature may drop (the unit is splitting its GPM between two fixtures).
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size water heater for a 3-bathroom house?">
    Three bathrooms doesn't necessarily mean three simultaneous showers. Size for your realistic peak demand. Most 3-bathroom households need a 50–75 gallon gas tank (FHR 67–90 gallons) or a gas tankless rated for 5.0–7.0 GPM. If all 3 showers might run simultaneously (e.g., a large family), you need a 75-gallon tank or two tankless units in parallel.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does a water heater cost to install in 2026?">
    Standard gas tank (50 gallon): $1,000–$1,800 installed. Standard electric tank (50 gallon): $800–$1,500 installed. Gas tankless: $2,000–$4,500 installed. Electric tankless: $1,000–$2,500 installed. Heat pump water heater: $2,000–$3,500 installed (before $2,000 IRA tax credit). Costs vary by region, complexity, and whether gas line or electrical upgrades are needed.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What temperature should I set my water heater?">
    The DOE recommends 120°F for most households. This prevents scalding, slows mineral buildup, and saves 3–5% energy per 10°F reduction from the common factory setting of 140°F. Households with immunocompromised individuals or dishwashers without built-in heaters may benefit from 130–140°F. Never set below 120°F, as lower temperatures allow Legionella bacteria to grow.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do I need to upgrade my gas line for a tankless water heater?">
    Almost always, yes. A standard 40–50 gallon gas tank heater uses a ½-inch gas line delivering 30,000–40,000 BTU. A whole-home tankless heater needs 150,000–199,000 BTU, requiring a ¾-inch or 1-inch gas line. Gas line upsizing costs $300–$1,500 depending on the run length and local codes. This is one of the hidden costs of converting from tank to tankless.
