# What Size AC for 1,500 Sq Ft?

**A 1,500 square foot home typically needs a 2.5-ton (30,000 BTU) air conditioner, with the range spanning from 2 tons in cool climates with good insulation to 3.5 tons in hot climates with poor insulation.** The 2.5-ton system is the single most common residential AC size in America, and 1,500 sq ft is the sweet spot where it shines.

At this square footage, you have clear system options: central AC, heat pump, or a multi-zone mini split can each handle the load efficiently. The key is matching the tonnage to your specific conditions rather than defaulting to a "standard" size.

<TableOfContents />

## AC Size for 1,500 Sq Ft by Climate Zone

| Climate Zone | Cities | BTU Range | Tonnage | Typical System |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zone 1 (Hot-Humid) | Miami, Key West | 37,500–45,000 | 3–3.5 ton | Central AC or HP |
| Zone 2 (Hot) | Houston, Phoenix, Tampa | 33,000–42,000 | 2.5–3.5 ton | Central AC or HP |
| Zone 3 (Warm) | Atlanta, Dallas, Charlotte | 30,000–37,500 | 2.5–3 ton | Central AC or HP |
| Zone 4 (Mixed) | Nashville, St. Louis, DC | 27,000–33,000 | 2.5 ton | Central AC or HP |
| Zone 5 (Cool) | Chicago, Denver, Boston | 24,000–30,000 | 2–2.5 ton | Central AC or HP |
| Zone 6 (Cold) | Minneapolis, Milwaukee | 21,000–27,000 | 2 ton | HP or AC + furnace |

## Adjustment Factors Specific to 1,500 Sq Ft Homes

1,500 sq ft homes commonly fall into these categories, each with different sizing implications:

| Home Type | Typical Construction | Sizing Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ranch (single-story) | Larger roof area, slab or crawlspace | Roof exposure adds load; no floor-to-floor loss |
| Split-level | Half-floors create natural zones | Consider zoning; upper sections run warmer |
| Small 2-story (750 per floor) | Less roof exposure than ranch | Upper floor needs more; lower floor less |
| Condo/townhouse | Shared walls reduce load | Interior units need 10–20% less BTU |
| Bungalow + finished attic | Attic rooms are hot spots | Attic floor may need dedicated cooling |
| Modular/manufactured | Variable insulation quality | Check actual R-values; often lower than stick-built |

<Callout type="example">
**Example 1: 1,500 sq ft single-story ranch in Dallas, TX (Zone 3)**

Average insulation (1998 build), 8-ft ceilings, moderate windows, open-plan living/kitchen, average ducts in attic.

- Base: 1,500 × 22 = 33,000 BTU
- Kitchen: +4,000 = 37,000
- Attic ducts: +15% = 42,550

**Result: 42,550 BTU → 3.5-ton system.** The attic ductwork is the big driver — in Texas heat, attic temps reach 140°F+, and uninsulated ducts lose 20–30% of cooling capacity. Insulating ducts or moving them to conditioned space would drop the requirement to a 2.5-ton system.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 2: 1,500 sq ft townhouse in Baltimore, MD (Zone 4)**

Shared walls on both sides, 3 stories (500 sq ft per floor), good insulation (2012 build), 9-ft ceilings.

- Base: 1,500 × 18 = 27,000 BTU (shared walls reduce load)
- 9-ft ceilings: +12% = 30,240
- 3-story heat stratification: +10% = 33,264
- Ducts in conditioned space: −10% = 29,938

**Result: 29,938 BTU → 2.5-ton system.** The shared walls significantly reduce the load compared to a standalone house. A 2.5-ton system handles this well. For a 3-story townhouse, zoning dampers or a two-zone system improves comfort on the top floor.
</Callout>

<Callout type="example">
**Example 3: 1,500 sq ft manufactured home in Tucson, AZ (Zone 2)**

Below-average insulation, flat metal roof, single-pane windows, exposed ductwork under the home.

- Base: 1,500 × 26 = 39,000 BTU
- Poor insulation: +25% = 48,750
- Single-pane windows: +15% = 56,063
- Under-home duct losses: +15% = 64,472
- Dry climate: −10% = 58,025

**Result: 58,025 BTU → 5-ton system.** Manufactured homes in hot climates are among the hardest to cool efficiently. Upgrading windows and insulating ducts would reduce this to a 3–3.5 ton system — saving $1,500–$2,000 on equipment plus $300–$500/year on electricity.

| Heat pump (cold-climate) | 3 ton | $7,000–$11,000 | 17–22 | $300–$450 (cool+heat) | Zones 4–6 |
| Mini split (3-zone) | 30K total | $6,000–$10,000 | 18–28 | $200–$350 | No ducts, zone control |

*Annual cooling costs based on 1,000–1,500 cooling hours at $0.15/kWh.*

## Ductwork Considerations for 1,500 Sq Ft

At 1,500 sq ft, ductwork design significantly affects whether you need 2.5 or 3.5 tons:

| Ductwork Scenario | Impact on Sizing | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Ducts in conditioned space (basement, interior walls) | −10% (saves 0.5 ton) | Best case scenario |
| Insulated ducts in unconditioned attic | +0% (baseline) | Standard situation |
| Uninsulated ducts in attic | +15–20% (adds 0.5 ton) | Insulate before replacing AC |
| Leaky, uninsulated ducts in attic | +25–30% (adds 1 ton) | Seal and insulate — $500–$1,500 investment saves $200–$400/year |
| No existing ducts | N/A — choose ductless | Mini splits avoid duct losses entirely |

<Callout type="warning">
**Before buying a bigger AC, fix your ducts.** A 1,500 sq ft home with leaky attic ductwork might calculate at 3.5 tons. Sealing and insulating those ducts for $1,000–$2,000 drops the requirement to 2.5 tons — saving $1,000–$2,000 on equipment plus $200–$400/year in energy. The duct work pays for itself in 2–3 years.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ>
  <FAQ.Item question="Is a 2.5-ton AC good for 1,500 sq ft?">
    In most cases, yes. A 2.5-ton system (30,000 BTU) matches a 1,500 sq ft home at the standard 20 BTU/sq ft baseline. In Zones 3–6 with average to good insulation, 2.5 tons is the right size. In hot climates (Zone 2) or homes with poor insulation, you may need 3 tons. In Zone 1 (South Florida), 3–3.5 tons may be appropriate.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How much does a 2.5-ton AC cost?">
    A 2.5-ton central AC costs $3,800–$10,000 installed in 2026, depending on brand and efficiency level. Budget systems (SEER2 14–15) run $3,800–$5,500. Mid-range (SEER2 17–19) run $5,500–$7,500. Premium variable-speed systems (SEER2 20+) run $7,500–$10,000. These include the outdoor condenser, indoor evaporator coil, refrigerant, labor, and permit.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Can a 2-ton AC cool 1,500 sq ft?">
    A 2-ton system (24,000 BTU) can cool 1,500 sq ft in Zone 5–6 with good insulation (16 BTU/sq ft), or in a well-shaded home in Zone 4. In warmer climates or homes with average/poor insulation, 2 tons is undersized — the system will run continuously on hot days without reaching setpoint. For most 1,500 sq ft homes, 2.5 tons is the safer choice.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size heat pump for 1,500 sq ft?">
    For cooling: 2.5 tons in moderate climates, 3 tons in hot climates. For heating: the heating load often requires 3–3.5 tons in Zones 5–6 because heat pump capacity drops in cold weather. A 3-ton cold-climate heat pump is the most versatile choice for 1,500 sq ft in most of the US. In Zones 1–3, a standard 2.5-ton heat pump handles both loads.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How many mini splits for 1,500 sq ft?">
    Typically 2–4 indoor heads depending on floor plan. An open-plan 1,500 sq ft space might work with 2 heads. A 3-bedroom home typically needs 3–4 heads: one for the main living area (12,000–18,000 BTU), one for the master bedroom (9,000 BTU), and one or two for secondary bedrooms (6,000–9,000 BTU each). See our guide on how many mini splits you need for detailed calculations.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="3 ton vs 2.5 ton for 1,500 sq ft?">
    For average conditions in Zones 3–5, 2.5 tons is the right size. A 3-ton system oversizes by 20%, which causes short cycling with single-stage equipment. However, a 3-ton two-stage or variable-speed system runs comfortably at low stage (1.8–2.1 tons) most of the time and ramps to 3 tons only on the hottest days — a good fit if you're between sizes. In Zones 1–2, 3 tons is often correctly sized.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What's the electricity bill for AC in a 1,500 sq ft house?">
    Monthly AC costs for 1,500 sq ft: $40–$65 in moderate climates, $65–$100 in warm climates, and $80–$140 in hot climates — assuming a SEER2 16 system at $0.15/kWh. Higher-efficiency systems (SEER2 20+) reduce these by 20–30%. Annual totals: $250–$550 in moderate climates, $500–$900 in hot climates.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="Do I need two AC units for 1,500 sq ft?">
    Almost never. A single 2.5–3 ton system handles 1,500 sq ft efficiently. Two units only make sense for 2-story homes with no duct connection between floors, or when the home has a finished attic or addition that can't be reached by the existing duct system. Two 1.5-ton units cost significantly more to install and maintain than one 2.5-ton unit.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="What size furnace pairs with a 2.5-ton AC for 1,500 sq ft?">
    A 2.5-ton AC requires an air handler or furnace with a blower rated for 800–1,000 CFM of airflow. Furnace sizes commonly paired: 60,000–80,000 BTU in Zones 3–4, 80,000–100,000 BTU in Zones 5–6. The furnace size is determined by your heating load (independent of cooling), but the blower motor must match the AC's airflow requirement. AHRI-matched systems ensure compatibility.
  </FAQ.Item>

  <FAQ.Item question="How long does it take to cool a 1,500 sq ft house?">
    A properly sized 2.5-ton AC in a 1,500 sq ft home reduces indoor temperature by 1–2°F per hour once it reaches steady state. Starting from a very hot house (e.g., returning from vacation with the AC off), reaching a comfortable 75°F from 90°F takes 4–8 hours. Daily operation (starting from 78–80°F when the AC kicks on) reaches setpoint in 15–30 minutes. If your system takes much longer, it may be undersized.
